	abstract = {The problem of poverty still affects many countries and people worldwide, including Indonesia, especially in Jeneponto Regency. This study discusses the multi-partner governance model in managing the fundraising of Zakat funds to alleviate poverty. This model involves various institutions and actors to optimize the collection and use of Zakat funds to help those in need. This study analyzed indicators of actor participation, actor perspectives, actor accessibility, and determination of action to measure each institution’s and actor’s contribution to the multi-partner governance model. The analysis results show that the actor’s perspective dominates with the highest score, showing a strong interest in poverty alleviation. However, challenges in this model were also identified, including effective coordination and collaboration, power imbalances, limited resources, conflicts, personal interests, the complexity of the problem of poverty, and community participation. To overcome these challenges, this study recommends solutions such as building a suitable coordination mechanism, achieving a fair balance of power, increasing the allocation and management of resources, managing conflict and self-interest, adopting a holistic approach to overcoming the complexity of the problem of poverty, and building a mechanism for community participation that is effective. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Temporary waqf, as an innovative form of waqf, offers a level of flexibility that permanent waqf lacks. By allowing fund allocation for a set period, temporary waqf holds significant potential for improving social welfare of the Muslim Community. It enables the use of funds to respond quickly to urgent and varied needs, such as infrastructure development and public facilities. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of temporary waqf in enhancing social welfare of the Muslim Community, focusing on fund allocation flexibility, investment efficiency, and positive economic impacts. The research adopts a library research approach, collecting and analyzi ng relevant literature on temporary waqf. Data are sourced from academic publications, regulatory documents, and waqf management-related reports. The analysis examines how temporary waqf affects the execution of social and economic projects and its overall influence on the community. Results indicate that temporary waqf allows for more adaptable and responsive fund allocation, accelerating the implementation of both social and economic programs. Temporary waqf funds can be invested in productive projects that generat e immediate benefits, such as building infrastructure and healthcare facilities. These projects contribute to improving the quality of life, stimulating local economic growth, and creating employment opportunities. The study suggests raising public awareness about t emporary waqf, formulating supportive policies, and promoting collaboration with the private sector and financial institutions. By implementing these recommendations, temporary waqf can further maximize its impact, enhance fund management efficiency, and contribute to sustainable development across Muslim Community. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

This research aims to evaluate the potential implementation of forest endowments (waqf) through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The study employs two methodologies: a comprehensive SWOT analysis to examine internal and external factors and the Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) and External Factor Evaluation (EFE) methods within the SWOT matrix framework. Data were gathered via questionnaires distributed to representatives of environmental care communities. The findings indicate that internal factors, particularly potential strengths, support the implementation of waqf forests. Internal and external factors contribute to these strengths, enhancing the potential for successful implementation. Weaknesses can be mitigated by leveraging existing strengths. External factors are categorized into opportunities, which can promote the development of waqf forest strategies, and threats, which necessitate strategic interventions. The analysis reveals that the strength factor scores higher overall than the weakness factor, suggesting a promising outlook for successful implementation. These research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of waqf forest implementation by thoroughly analyzing the relevant internal and external factors. The identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats provide valuable guidance for stakeholders aiming to optimize the use of waqf forests for environmental conservation and sustainable management. © 2024 The authors.},

	abstract = {This research aimed at analyzing the effectiveness of the Bankziska program in empowering victims of loan sharks through the al-Qarḍ al-Ḥasan contract funded by zakat, administered by the Amil Zakat Infaq and Shadaqah of Muhammadiyah Institutions. Qualitative method was used in this research with a phenomenological approach using the activity data from the Amil Zakat Infaq and Shadaqah of Muhammadiyah Institutions in empowering loan shark victims through the Bankziska program. The data sources were obtained from managers, volunteers, and loan shark victims who were the partners of Bankziska. The research results showed that the reasons for the Amil Zakat Infaq and Shadaqah of Muhammadiyah Institutions to lend zakat funds were the references from fiqh and fatwa, training studies, organizational encouragement, academic input, and it is easy to implement. The implementation of the Bankziska program had detailed standard operating procedures, starting from the beneficiary categories, distribution, and payment processes, to mitigating the risk of default. The al-Qarḍ al-Ḥasan program of Bankziska had an impact on improving the quality of skills, mental, intellectual, technological, communication, and religious studies of managers and volunteers. The impact of the program for partners was the awareness to abandon usury, reduced debt both in nominal terms and the number of loan sharks and an increase in the ethos of economic independence. This research contributes to providing discourse and alternatives for other social and religious fund management institutions in using zakat funds productively for economic empowerment through the al-Qarḍ al-Ḥasan contract for victims of loan sharks who have difficulty accessing Sharia financial institutions to obtain business capital or financing services. © 2024, Universitas Islam Negeri Mahmud Yunus Batusangkar.

The results show, first, Malaysia employs a centralized and technologically integrated approach, ensuring transparency and efficiency in zakat collection and distribution. In contrast, Turkey adopts a decentralized model driven by non-governmental organizations and community participation, fostering flexibility but posing challenges in standardization and oversight. Indonesia's hybrid model combines governmental oversight with private sector involvement, aiming to balance regulatory control with local adaptability, yet needs help in coordination and public trust. Second, the policy enhancements such as improved coordination mechanisms, strengthened regulatory frameworks, and enhanced public awareness to optimize Zakat's role in poverty alleviation and social welfare across Malaysia, Turkey, and Indonesia.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact factors towards the use of mobile banking among the asnaf for efficient zakat payments by using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model with additional constructs such as religiosity, attitude and trust (initial trust model) in the Malaysian context. Design/methodology/approach: The structural equation modelling is used to analyse the data collected from 470 asnaf in Selangor, Malaysia, using the survey methodology. Findings: This study highlights factors that could influence the asnaf to adopt financial technology (fintech) in order for them to enjoy the benefit of efficient zakat distribution by the zakat institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study only investigates and contributes added value from the Malaysian context. While it may be similar to other countries that share similar demographic profiles, it might differ for countries that do not have any demographic similarities with Malaysia. Practical implications: The result of this study highlights the significant factor that practitioners (zakat institutions) in Malaysia could improve fintech adoption and at the same time enhance the efficiency of zakat distribution for the asnaf. Social implications: This research is basically addressing Islamic social financing. Thus, this study has social implications to address the society's poverty eradication scheme pertaining to the efficiency of zakat institutions in Malaysia for the speedier zakat payments to the asnaf. However, other emerging issues also arise particularly in using the zakat funds by the zakat institutions. By right whatever expenditure that the institutions use from the zakat funds need to have the consent from the asnaf because of their religious and legal rights. Hence, this new gap found from the findings of this study could be further explored by other researchers in future studies especially focusing on the drive towards more efficient administration by the zakat institutions of Malaysia in particular and other zakat institutions spread over Muslim countries elsewhere. Originality/value: This study found that the UTAUT2 model is rarely used and adopted in investigating technology acceptance and adoption especially when it is related to religious matters such as zakat. Indeed, the findings of this study could be acknowledged as something of original value and significance, therefore contributes to the body of knowledge in this field. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine how beliefs and expectations on collaboration for investment, technology advancement and governance can lead to sustainable income generation that succeeds in influencing the community to accept the proposed Waqf integrated income generating model (WIIGM). Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically examined the beliefs and expectations on the proposed WIIGM model, which was adapted from the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Data was collected from 366 respondents selected via convenience sampling. Questionnaires were distributed online, of which responses were then analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling for hypothesis testing. Ethical approval is also gathered before the data collection begins. Findings: This study found that collaboration for investment and governance significantly contribute to sustainable income generation in waqf operations and management, which eventually results in the community’s trust and acceptance of the WIIGM model. Technology advancement also significantly influences sustainable income generation, which finally leads to the community's behavioural intention to participate in the WIIGIM model. Further studies on this variable may establish findings from other perspectives. Practical implications: This paper is an original study that empirically examines the potential for a new waqf integrated income-generating model in building the trust of the community towards waqf institutions. This study is significantly important for practitioners and policymakers in evaluating the potential roles of waqf based on the belief and trust of the community.

	abstract = {As one of the alternative forms of Islamic Social Finance, Waqf could be potentially developed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in Indonesia, particularly providing a major solution for socio-economic problems, such as poverty, improving education quality, and giving a lifelong learning opportunity, unemployment, and many more. But, unfortunately, due to the absence of a universal standard of Waqf evaluation, the implementation of Waqf in Indonesia has not been optimal. Therefore, this study proposes the National Waqf Index (Indeks Wakaf Nasional or IWN) for improving the governance system and measuring waqf performance at national and regional levels. Through literature review and focus group discussion (FGD), this study develops six factors, namely regulatory (with three sub-factors), institution (with two sub-factors), process (with four sub-factors), system (with three sub-factors), outcome (with two sub-factors), and impact (with four sub-factors). Using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) involving experts from government, academic, and industry, this study finds that the priority of IWN is a regulatory factor (0.282) followed by institution factor (0.251), process factor (0.190), system factor (0.156), outcome factor (0.069), and impact factor (0.050). The findings from this study will strengthen the existing literature in Waqf and be used to develop the governance system to improve performance. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) owners’ intentions to participate in waqf, involving two countries, which are Malaysia and Indonesia, using the theory of planned behavior. SMEs are the backbone of many economies, representing 95% of all companies worldwide and accounting for 60% of employment. Based on this fact, this paper analyzes the influence of religiosity, knowledge and attitude to predict the intentions of SMEs’ owners in waqf participation in Malaysia and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Data were randomly obtained from 175 SMEs owners from Malaysia and Indonesia with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) used for analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis data suggest that knowledge and attitude show a significant impact on the intentions of SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf, while religiosity does not have a significant impact on the intentions of Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf. Practical implications: This study aims to assist SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia to formulate appropriate strategies and marketing using waqf for the sustainability of SMEs which represent more than 90% of business establishments in both countries. The strategy is a necessity, especially because the government is targeting to promote a sustainable Islamic financial system, improve governance policy and halal industry for SMEs, strengthen the development of Malay Reserve land, providing as financial independence to higher learning institutions and invest in digitalization and advanced technology through waqf funds. Therefore, both countries should take the initiative to provide training to equip SMEs with extensive knowledge through multiple platforms to further encourage their participation in waqf. Originality/value: Because of the increasing interest in waqf participation both in Malaysia and Indonesia, this study claims three essential contributions. First, it aims to examine the intention of SMEs in waqf participation among the business owners in Malaysia and Indonesia. Second, the study findings are expected to benefit the development of literature in accordance with Islamic social finance, particularly waqf. Third, this study provides an insight into the inclusive knowledge and attitude of SME owners and their intention to participate in waqf. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses both quantitative and qualitative data types that will be collected through questionnaires, secondary data, interviews and experimental tests to answer key questions. The collected data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis ANOVA. This study determines the factors affecting the default rate of Islamic microfinance (MF) products, and evaluates the repayment performance of IFMF products using field experiments. Findings: The participants found that the repayment performance level is higher than that of Qard Al-Hassan, which shows that it is one of the best mechanisms to reduce the default rate among borrowers. It has been observed that women have higher repayment performance than men, and those with different income sources have higher repayment performance levels than those who do not. This study showed that the effects of age, marital status and educational status on the repayment performance level of the participants were not statistically significant. In addition, it was shown that the participants’ status of having or not having children did not have a significant effect on the level of repayment performance. Originality/value: This study differs from other studies in two ways. First, in terms of field experimentation, this study focuses on the practical impact of IFMF products on customer reimbursement performance. Second, this study tested different demographic variables that could affect the reimbursement performance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments all over the globe to bring radical changes to all walks of life. Strict lockdowns are not only adversely affecting the social, economic, and psychological wellbeing of individuals but also questioning the sustainability of most businesses. In wake of the current scenario, this study is aimed at exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing the sustainability of entrepreneurship particularly from a female perspective and further providing insights into the role of Islamic financial institutions in the sustainability of businesses during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study that takes social constructivism approach to study the underlying phenomenon. Semi-structured interviews are conducted to collect primary data. Secondary data are also utilized in this study to theoretically define various concepts relating to entrepreneurial sustainability. The application of thematic analysis revealed various risks associated with sustainability. The interviews reveal the ground realities and tell us about the hardships being faced by the entrepreneurs due to ongoing crises. The participants of the study also shed light on the role of Islamic financial institutions during the pandemic. Findings: The study results revealed that it may look impossible for women entrepreneurs to halt or avoid the adverse consequences of the pandemic; however, a few female entrepreneurs strived to guard their existing portfolios with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. Whereas, several women, especially those running home-based businesses, lost their income streams. Despite these rapid challenges, most female entrepreneurs are working on inventive online systems to sustain their business activities during the crisis. Finally, guidelines are suggested which can help achieve sustainability of the entrepreneurial startups. Research limitations/implications: The outcomes of this study are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and Islamic financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during severe disasters like COVID-19. Moreover, the study is a helpful tool for women entrepreneurs to avert the worst impact of the pandemic with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. The themes of this study help generate realistic information to appraise the strategies to create facilitating business environments that drive the women to carry out the entrepreneurial activity during any crisis like the COVID-19. Practical implications: The results of this study provide evidence that crisis can be anticipated up to some extent if entrepreneurs become able to take proactive decisions in case of expected or identifiable threats. The study may also help the women entrepreneurs to comprehend the serious consequences of the pandemic by shifting their mode of financing to Islamic finance. Although this pandemic is a cause of physical discomfort instead this research may encourage the female entrepreneurs not to lose heart, just find the potential opportunities for their home-based and small businesses and manage funding from the Islamic microfinance institutions. Originality/value: The study adds to the existing literature on entrepreneurial sustainability with a particular focus on the role of Islamic microfinance institutions for women entrepreneurs' sustainability in Pakistan. Secondly, the study employs the entrepreneurial sustainability model (ESM) that, according to the best of our knowledge, has not been used by the researchers earlier to study the given research phenomenon. Thirdly, the study findings are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during disasters like COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The limited funds available for waqf-based forest development require nazhir to carefully choose the best location so that the asset can function optimally. However, no specific research has been conducted to guide the selection of the best location for this purpose. This study aimed to identify potential criteria to help determine the best site for developing a waqf-based forest. Several methods were used to collect the necessary data, including literature reviews, in-depth interviews, field observations, and focus group discussions. This study identifies four crucial criteria when selecting the best locations: a) legal, b) physical and biophysical, c) high conservation value and benefits, and d) management. In addition, each criterion has sub-criteria. Among all, legal issues receive the highest highlight as unresolved regulations can affect a forest's ownership and function. This study was the first to discuss these criteria. Future research should quantify the criteria suggested using GIS and conduct more field observations in existing waqf-based forests in Indonesia. © 2024 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

It is considered the most detrimental economic and social issue, being the root cause of human rights vio-lations due to its destructive effects on individuals and society. In the modern era, poverty has become a major global issue, hindering economic and human development and leading to deprivation of well-being. Any credit type, micro or nano credit, must be implemented well to help the poor. Recently, there has been an interest in nanocredit. Although there are limited studies on nanocredit, there have been some attempts to review the topic. In contrast to other research, this study adopts a different methodology to thoroughly review the literature on the development of nanocredit to address the innovative and reliable tools that are dependable financial inclusion for the under-privileged. This study is being conducted to comprehensively review and analyse current research on nanocredit. Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), Emerald Insights, and Google Scholar index the reviewed literature from 2000 to 2022 for published article access. Studies have presented that nanocredit is a new paradigm in the lending industry with fewer requirements and bureaucracy. Although it is still lacking in fully complying with Shariah guidelines, nanocredit is a saviour for the poor in improving their quality of life. In simple understanding, nanocredit should be the bridge that connects Islamic finance and Islamic philanthropy. © 2024 by the author(s).},

Design/Methodology/Approach — This study is based on the interpretivist paradigm. Keywords related to Muslims’ obligations, zakat and taxes were sourced to find relevant literature. A thematic analysis was conducted of in-depth interview data from Kiai Pesantren regarding their perspectives on state fund management. Findings — The results show the importance of FTPA in state fund management, especially when aligned with Islamic principles. Fiscal transparency involves directing tax funds towards poverty alleviation alongside infrastructure development. The involvement of religious organisations can be aimed at fostering moral responsibility among officials, while citizen participation can be facilitated through open data for budget planning. The accountability of public officials must be accompanied by efforts to minimise corruption and enforce strict punishments for corrupt activities. Moreover, fully crediting zakat payments for Muslim taxpayers could improve tax compliance, but this requires assurance through future policy reforms. Originality/Value — This study contributes to the literature by integrating Islamic principles into the framework of FTPA.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the impact of Zakat avoidance on firm value and investigates how board characteristics moderate this relationship within the context of Saudi Arabia, a Muslim nation. Design/methodology/approach: Using panel data from 2009 to 2020, encompassing 78 nonfinancial firms listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange, this study constructs an enhanced measure of Zakat avoidance that integrates insights from tax avoidance research, Shariah principles and the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority. This research uses empirical techniques, including panel data regressions and interaction analysis to investigate how board characteristics may influence this relationship. Findings: Descriptive analysis reveals pervasive Zakat compliance, underscoring the effectiveness of Saudi Arabia’s robust Zakat system. Regression results indicate a positive association between Zakat payment and firm value. Remarkably, board characteristics exhibit no significant link to Zakat avoidance, emphasizing the potency of the Zakat system and religious adherence. However, the moderation analysis reveals that board independence and meeting frequency positively moderate the relationship between Zakat avoidance and firm value. Practical implications: The study emphasizes the vital importance of upholding Zakat obligations to cultivate trust among stakeholders and amplify firm value. It advocates for governance frameworks that foster vigilant oversight and independence, ultimately enhancing a firm’s overall worth. Furthermore, the study’s findings provide valuable insights for corporate leaders, investors, policymakers and society as a whole, facilitating the promotion of ethical financial conduct and driving holistic economic development. Originality/value: This research introduces novel insights by scrutinizing the intricate interplay of Zakat avoidance, board dynamics and firm value within the context of a culturally distinctive emerging economy. The development of a distinct Zakat avoidance metric, along with comprehensive empirical assessment, contributes to the originality of the study. Moreover, the investigation into the moderating influence of board characteristics adds value to the existing body of knowledge. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to find empirical evidence related to the influence of organisational capability and social capability on organisational sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation (OPZ). This study also wants to prove that OPZ's social capability can moderate the influence of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. Theoretical Framework: Providing professional organisational capacity is a form of OPZ's responsibility to improve the community's welfare through trustworthy zakat management. Thus, achieving organisational goals requires the importance of organisational capacity. Based on the stewardship theory, management is not motivated by individual goals but instead focuses on their primary goal for the organisation's benefit. Method: The methodology used in this study is a quantitative approach and the data analysis was carried out with the Moderated Regression Analysis model. Results and Discussion: The results of the research reveal that both organisational capacity and social capability have a positive influence on organisational sustainability. Furthermore, social capabilities have a positive moderating effect on the effect of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. The test results show that the moderation in this study is included in the type of quasi-moderation. Research Implications: The results imply that the organisational capacity and social capability of OPZs have an essential role in determining organisational sustainability, where the social capability of amil zakat agencies becomes a determinant to strengthening organisational capacity in supporting the sustainability of amil zakat agencies. Originality/Value: This research provides new insights into the role of organisational capacity and social capability in achieving sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation. This study aligned with SDG 1 (No Poverty) by enhancing the management of Zakat funds to improve community welfare. © 2024, Editora Alumni In. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the Urban Poor Development Scheme (UPDS) and the Rural Development Scheme (RDS), both of which are types of Islamic Microfinance Institutions. It examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these two categories of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IsMFIs). The significant decline in economic activity during the pandemic has significantly impacted the lives of several people, especially those who are debtors of multinational Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IsMFIs). A more robust understanding of the need for financial inclusion and increased demand for digital financial services are two instances of the potential that Bangladeshi IsMFIs have identified their challenges. The significance of this research lies in the pivotal role that IsMFIs assume in alleviating poverty at the national level, namely among marginalized populations. This study fills the knowledge gap about the opportunities and challenges that COVID-19 poses for IsMFIs operating in Bangladesh. The principle behind this methodology is library research, which entails gathering and assessing data from various sources. Yearly reports from UPDS, RDS, and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics supplement data gathering. The study process was underpinned by the use of robust quantitative research methodologies. Strategies for expanding foreign financial institutions in Bangladesh following the COVID-19 pandemic are formulated based on the study results, highlighting the potential for significant growth and expansion in this sector. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the microfinance sector, this study examines the current scholarly discourse on the obstacles and prospects that IsMFIs in Bangladesh encounter. Furthermore, it will furnish astute insights concerning these obstacles and prospects. This study's findings provide practical guidance for policymakers and other stakeholders in advocating for IsMFIs, thereby mitigating the disease's impact on Bangladesh's impoverished population. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

To help redress this imbalance, we present findings on the motivations, strategies, methods, and impact of five large philanthropically funded voluntary organizations in Pakistan. We ask how and why such organizations are formed and gain traction to provide valuable services for large numbers of poor people in a society riddled with inequalities. Although differing considerably in their relations to markets and philanthropy, we find that success in all cases followed from commitment to Islamic philanthropy and the ideal of social inclusion, social innovation, exploitation of social capital, and scaling-up.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose a productive waqf-based financing model for the livestock sector by optimizing idle waqf land owned by Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) for livestock breeding and fattening projects. Most pesantrens are established on waqf land and are located in rural areas with great potential for implementing waqf-based livestock projects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a critical review on the models of waqf-based empowerment and financing for the livestock, agriculture or agribusiness sectors. Then, a proposed model was designed focused on livestock sector by using waqf land owned by pesantren. To strengthen the proposed model, the authors held a focus group discussion (FGD) by inviting regulators, academics, practitioners/consultants in animal husbandry, waqf, pesantren and economic empowerment. Findings: Pesantren as nazhir of waqf land can cooperate with baitul maal wat tamwil (BMT) acting as nazhir of cash waqf to form a breeders’ cooperative as the vehicle to carry out the process of producing and fattening cattle. The project is performed under a mudharaba, musharakah or ijara contract, which is supervised by pesantren and BMT. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on the Indonesian context due to it is influenced by country-specific conditions. Even so, some of the findings in this study can still be adopted by waqf asset managers in other Muslim countries, which also have potential in terms of the number of pesantren and waqf assets. Social implications: The proposed model can improve the quality of life of the poor in remote areas by fulfilling the demand for beef consumption accompanied by sustainable economic empowerment. Originality/value: This research focuses on solving the problem of meeting basic needs for beef by optimizing productive waqf in the livestock sector by involving the role of pesantren, which still needs to be discovered in the literature on the use of waqf land. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to investigate the impact of credit risk-taking on financial and social efficiency and examine the relationship between credit risk, capital structure and efficiency in the context of Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs) compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The stochastic frontier approach was used to estimate the financial and social efficiency scores, in a first step. In a second step, the impact of risk-taking on efficiency was evaluated. The authors also took into account the moderating role of capital structure in this effect using the fixed and random effects generalized least squares (GLS) with a first-order autoregressive disturbance. The used dataset covers 326 conventional MFIs and 57 Islamic MFIs in six different regions of the world over the period of 2005–2015. Findings: The overall average efficiency scores are less than 50%, where CMFIs could have produced their outputs using 48% of their actual inputs. IMFIs record the lowest financial (cost) efficiency that is equal to 28% on average. The estimation results also reveal a negative impact of nonperforming loan on financial and social efficiency. Finally, the moderating effect of leverage funding on the relationship between credit risk-taking and financial efficiency was confirmed in CMFIs. However, leverage seems to moderate the effect of risk-taking behavior on social efficiency for IMFIs. Originality/value: This paper makes an initial attempt to evaluate the effect of risk-taking decision and its implication on efficiency and MFIs' sustainability. Besides, it takes into consideration the role played by the mode of governance through the ownership structure. In addition, this research study sheds light on the importance of the financial support for the development and sustainability of these institutions, which in return, contributes to a sustainable economic development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Zakat is an important Islamic economic instrument that plays significant role in Sustainable Development Goals. Accordingly, Zakat Institutions must manage zakat in a proper and efficient manner. This study aims to examine the efficiency of Zakat Institutions based on their clusters which are government, business and social organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses three quantitative methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA), free disposal hull and super-efficiency DEA. The analytical method is based on production approach, variable return to scale assumption and output orientation. The sample consists of 14 Zakat Institutions from three clusters: Zakat Institutions managed by government, Zakat Institutions managed by corporation and Zakat Institution managed by social organizations. Findings: The results revealed that all of three techniques culminate the same ranking order of efficiency. Zakat Institution managed by the government is the most efficient Zakat Institution, with the average value of 0.87 by using three approaches combined. Meanwhile, Zakat Institutions owned by company and social institutions cluster are in second and third position, with the average value of 0.65 and 0.4, respectively, based on the results of the three approaches. This study contends that the level of efficiency of Zakat Institutions may be supported by clusters (affiliations) in their management. Research limitations/implications: This study’s limitation is the inadequacy of the required data. Nonetheless, this study provides insights to improve the efficiency of Zakat Institutions based on their clusters. Zakat Institutions in each cluster can improve their efficiency by optimizing inputs to produce multiple outputs. Originality/value: This study enhances research on the efficiency of Zakat Institutions using three methods to assess the consistency and strength of Zakat Institutions’ efficiency values.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to reveal and analyze the practice of changing the exchange status of waqf assets in the view of the Islamic social economy. This type of research is included in qualitative research, which is derived from interviews and data observation. The source of this research data consists of primary data sources, namely researchers directly conduct interviews with the parties concerned in the process of exchanging waqf property at the At-Taqwa mosque, researchers also use secondary data sources, namely books, articles, and other reference materials. The results of the study explained that in the case of exchanging waqf property at Masjid At-Taqwa by Government Regulation Number 28 of 1977 and Law Number 41 of 2004. As for the aspect of Islamic Law, in the opinion of Imam Hanafi, if the waqf property can no longer provide benefits, it can be exchanged or replaced. On the contrary, according to the Shafi'iyah and Maliki Schools, it forbids all forms of exchange and replacement of waqf property under any circumstances. And according to Hanafiyah any form of exchange or replacement of all waqf objects depends on the power of the wakif at the time the pledge is pronounced by the wakif. The originality/novelty of this study offers originality by examining how changes in the status of waqf assets can affect people's welfare, both in terms of economics and society. In Islam, waqf is not only seen as charity but also as an economic instrument that can empower the community. Thus, a change in the status of waqf assets, for example from waqf land to commercial property, can have a significant impact on local economic empowerment. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

Utilising a qualitative research design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten participants, predominantly elderly women, to gain insights into their lived experiences as single mothers and recipients of zakat aid. The analysis identified key themes: financial instability, role strain and conflicting demands, childcare and parenting challenges, social stigma and isolation, and difficulties accessing resources. Despite these challenges, single mothers exhibit remarkable resilience and resourcefulness, drawing upon personal resilience, social support networks, formal aid systems, prioritisation and time management, spiritual and religious coping, and adaptation and resourcefulness. This study underscores the need for targeted interventions to support single mothers, addressing both their economic and emotional needs to enhance their well-being and societal integration. The findings highlight the importance of comprehensive support systems and the role of community and religious organisations in empowering single mothers to navigate their complex lives. © 2024 by author(s).},

	abstract = {The Bajo tribe is a traditional fishing community in Bone Regency, South Sulawesi, which faces the challenge of persistent poverty in various aspects. The National Zakat Amil Agency (BAZNAS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion has taken important steps to empower this community through educational values-based programs. This research aims to analyze the role of collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA in efforts to empower the coastal communities of the Bajo Tribe through the utilization of zakat. This research uses empirical legal methods using empowerment theory. Community development and empowerment aims to change community conditions for the better, in educational, economic, social, cultural, and political aspects. Data was collected by means of in-depth interviews with BAZNAS, KUA, and the Bajo tribal community, while literature studies referred to relevant articles, books and research reports. The research results show that the collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA has contributed to changing the mindset of the Bajo Tribe in educating the Bajo Tribe community so that they improve spiritually, health and religious education. The challenges faced are the lack of realization of more massive program sustainability and the lack of active involvement of the community, stakeholders and the importance of realizing community empowerment through zakat environmental development in accordance with the BAZNAS RI program which is intended for community groups who experience economic, educational, health, spiritual and economic disadvantage welfare. Even though the results are not optimal, this contribution should be appreciated because it has had a significant impact on empowering the Bajo ethnic community on the Bone coast of South Sulawesi. © 2024, State Islamic University of Ar-Raniry Faculty of Sharia and Law.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to extend the Shapley value (SV) into a discussion of Zakat, a Pillar of Islam. Lloyd Shapley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012. This study shows that their relationship is significant for all nations, that of levelling up. An important but neglected paper by Datta (1939) showed insights provided by the Power Law, or as it is sometimes called, the Pareto distribution, into the role of Zakat in raising the income of all above the subsistence level. The Pareto distribution describes the prevailing tendency. The SV illustrates the interdependence perspective of Zakat with the Pareto distribution, wealth, income and poverty. Payoffs apply equally to both givers and receivers. For this study’s purposes, payoffs are considered as transferable utilities. They are formed by individuals who willingly cooperate in society rather than atomistic individuals who act independently. Zakat represents the recognition that society needs to be cooperative rather than individualistic; people cooperate in groups or societies to create value. SV implications and axioms are evaluated with an illustration. Design/methodology/approach: This study extends Datta’s approach by introducing distribution weights into the SV. The authors set out the concept of weighted Shapley values that retain the elements of randomness and marginal contribution to a coalition contained in pure/true SVs and weights that follow a ley-Pareto distribution. This paper is a viewpoint work that relies primarily on the author’s qualitative interpretation. Findings: The findings indicate that individual members of a coalition make multiple contributions that are often unrewarded. The contribution of one member of a coalition is dependent upon the contribution of others. The measure of contributions is payoffs, which have both monetary and non-monetary aspects; transferable payoffs or utilities are usually assumed. Furthermore, the significant agents in society or an organisation are stakeholders rather than the usual categories: managers, staff, shareholders, etc. Practical implications: Contextualising these concepts within the Islamic values and principles that guide Zakat administration is crucial to ensure that the distribution of Zakat funds is fair, equitable and meets the needs of all eligible recipients. By applying these concepts appropriately, Zakat administrators can ensure that the Zakat system functions effectively and fulfils its religious obligation. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is that it blends the SV and the idea behind Zakat by introducing the idea of alternatives of Shapley weights. The link between the institution of Zakat and SV in terms of equality, poverty elimination and wealth distribution should be at the top of the research agenda. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Research on waqf sustainability is increasing in popularity, showing exponential growth in publication and citation numbers. The realm of research has grown intricate and fragmented, thereby posing a growing challenge to the regulation of waqf sustainability. The main purpose of this study is to organise and integrate the preliminary studies on the theme of waqf sustainability. To this end, this study involved bibliometric analysis, distinguishing it from previous analyses, which were outdated and/or different focus. We collected 84 articles extracted from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, covering 20 years from 2001 to 2022. The findings showed that the most prolific authors were from Malaysia. There are five research themes regarding waqf sustainability, including the accountability of Islamic social finance as a third-sector economy, the sustainability of Islamic microfinance, the role of intellectual capital in waqf institutions, the effectiveness of management, and the performance measurement of waqf institutions. This study shows that the performance of waqf institutions for waqf sustainability is scant. Hence, there is an important research gap that can be addressed in future research since sustainability is a priority agenda as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) blueprint. © 2024 Vika Annisa Qurrata, Muhammad Hakimi Mohd.

The data are analyzed using the difference-in-difference (DiD) method, where the three impact indices are compared between the two groups of respondents in 2021 and 2022. We find that the CWLS empowerment programs improve the welfare and financial inclusion of beneficiaries but have no discernible effect on social and spiritual participation. However, the DID analysis reveals that the overall impacts of welfare, financial inclusion, and social and spiritual participation are not statistically different between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in 2021 and 2022.

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate the application of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory, along with the stewardship concept, in the context of zurri waqf reporting. The study aims to address the current lack of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf and explore how these accounting theories can contribute to establishing appropriate accounting principles and ensuring accountability, thereby supporting the achievement of SDG. Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework of this paper is grounded in positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory. Positive accounting theory seeks to explain and predict accounting behaviors and events, emphasizing the importance of accurate and relevant information for decision-making. Decision usefulness theory focuses on the provision of useful information to stakeholders, such as investors and creditors, to facilitate informed decision-making. The concept of stewardship, which involves looking after and protecting resources on behalf of others, is also integral to this framework, particularly in the context of waqf zurri, aligning with the goals of SDG to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. Methodology: This conceptual paper employs a thematic analysis of related literature to explore the relevance and application of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory to zurri waqf reporting. By examining existing research and theoretical perspectives, the study seeks to identify key themes and insights that can inform the development of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf, contributing to the SDG 16 objective of promoting transparency and accountability. Results and Discussion: The analysis reveals that the principles of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory are highly relevant to zurri waqf reporting. These theories provide a robust foundation for predicting and explaining accounting behaviors and events, highlighting the necessity of thorough and accurate reporting. The study also underscores the importance of stewardship in ensuring accountability by the parties responsible for managing zurri waqf properties and assets, thereby supporting the broader aim of SDG to strengthen institutions and ensure responsible management. Research Implications: The implications of this study emphasize the need for meticulous zurri waqf reporting, guided by essential accounting theories. By adopting these theories, organizations and individuals responsible for managing zurri waqf can enhance transparency, accountability, and the overall effectiveness of resource utilization, directly contributing to SDG. This study also contributes to the broader discourse on the role of accounting in non-profit and charitable activities, particularly within an Islamic context. Originality/Value: This paper offers original insights into the application of accounting theories to zurri waqf reporting, a relatively underexplored area in the existing literature. By integrating positive accounting theory, decision usefulness theory, and the concept of stewardship, the study provides a novel perspective on how these theoretical frameworks can address the challenges associated with the lack of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf. The findings contribute to the development of more robust and accountable reporting mechanisms for waqf zurri, ultimately benefiting both endowers and beneficiaries and supporting the institutional integrity emphasized by SDG. © 2024, Editora Alumni In.

	abstract = {Purpose: Zakat, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, holds the potential to significantly contribute to fiscal consolidation, particularly in developing nations. However, the national-level potential of Zakat often remains unexplored. This study aims to explore the potential of national-level Zakat and the opportunity to integrate it into the fiscal framework. Design/methodology/approach: This study estimates Zakat’s potential on national financial and economic components. The components include bank deposits, shares and securities, pensions (provident fund), industrial production and trade services, mining resources, Ushr on agro-crops and forestry, Ushr on livestock, Ushr on fishery, gross domestic product (GDP), national budget and national revenue. The study gathers data, ranging from FY2000 to FY2018, on national economic sectors from reliable secondary sources. The net value (NV) of each indicator is calculated as NV = TV − LA, where NV is the wage-adjusted net value after deducting the living adjustment (LA) value from the sectoral total. The proposed LA value, approximately 20%, is suggested to be deducted from the total sectoral value of each sector (excluding specific industries with preadjusted wages), equating to the Nisab value. Findings: It is estimated that the aggregate potential of Zakat in Bangladesh was US$9,749m in FY2018, compared to US$809m in FY2000, revealing the value is 3.77% of GDP and 21% of the national fiscal budget. In FY2018, the service sector was the largest contributor (30%), followed by bank deposits (23%). Pension funds made minimal contributions, whereas shares and bonds, as well as the manufacturing sector, each made a 10% contribution to the estimated Zakat potential. Zakat on agriculture output accounted for 15% of the total. The aggregate potential Zakat in FY2018 was 12% higher than that in FY2000. Originality/value: The paper highlights a novel contribution through its nuanced analysis of sector-specific Zakat on macrolevel data and its implications within the fiscal framework. The results suggest that Zakat has substantial potential to impact fiscal dynamics, providing valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to recognize the national-level Zakat for development plans such as the five-year plan. The study suggests piloting a central and independent national body to study the feasibility of national-level Zakat collection and its utilization in the fiscal budget. It will help the government reduce the burden of external debt and deficit budget and, instead, will promote revenue collection in collaboration with the National Board of Revenue. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite the significant growth in Islamic economies and the increasing number of Muslim youths inclining digital services, empirical-based research addressing the adoption of digital Islamic services is still limited. ZakaTech is a new phrase that has recently emerged as a modern term describing novel technologies adopted by zakat institutions; yet, it has been largely neglected in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to provide an integrated model that scrutinizes the determinants of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) of ZakaTech, combined with social cognitive theory (SCT), in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis where social distancing is the norm in conducting economic activities. Design/methodology/approach: Based on cross-national evidence from two Muslim-majority countries, a total of 1,006 valid responses were collected from zakat payer users in Saudi Arabia and Egypt using a Web-based survey. To validate the research model and draw significant insights, SmartPLS structural equation modeling was used. Findings: By analyzing both Saudi and Egyptian samples, the authors found that all UTAUT constructs are statistically significant, except for effort expectancy in Egypt. The effects of self-efficacy and social isolation on ZakaTech adoption are supported across both countries. Trust in technology reduces users’ inherent risks and increases their likelihood of adopting ZakaTech services in Saudi Arabia, while this is not the case in Egypt. However, the study revealed that trust in electronic-zakat systems (EZSs) is a vital predictor for mitigating perceived risk among Egyptian users of ZakaTech, but it is not the case in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, significant gender differences were found between males and females in the adoption of such digital services in both countries, particularly regarding self-efficacy, trust in EZSs, social isolation and social influence. Practical implications: The results provide meaningful insights for policymakers to find ways to develop strategies to escalate the adoption of technology in zakat administration and also to create awareness among the users of ZakaTech in a gender-balanced manner that will include zakat payers and recipients as well in the hope that the digital gender divide will be bridged. Bridging the digital gender divide in this regard is imperative for sustainable inclusive development of zakat. Further, strategies need to be developed to provide incentives to zakat authorities and zakat organizations that adopt technology in managing zakat. This is important to escalate the process of fusing technology with zakat, which is an important social finance tool to eradicate poverty in the world. Originality/value: This research serves as a building block for literature by empirically testing an integrated model of UTAUT-SCT within a modern and unique related context like ZakaTech. Also, it adds value by testing gender disparities in ZakaTech adoption among Muslims. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Objective: The problem of poverty requires a social innovation-based assistance strategy that involves various parties or collaboration in solving a social problem. Poverty alleviation policies are not only centered on bureaucratic aspects but are also always human-centered (human-centered design) in defining and formulating innovative policies. This research aims to identify stakeholders in social innovation in order to overcome the impacts of poverty. Theoretical framework: This research uses 6 dimensions of social innovation in analyzing the impact of poverty in Indonesia. Apart from that, this research also explains the role of stakeholders through the Quintuple Helix concept where there is a continuous balance between government and society. Method: This research is a type of qualitative research with 50 research informants who refer to five requirements for selecting informants. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with social practitioners so that researchers could get more concrete information about the problems that occurred. Results and conclusions: In the Social Exclusion Dynamics dimension, it was found that the Indonesian Government's policies were able to provide accelerated handling that was not trapped in bureaucratic, techno-technical aspects. By making the community work partners or volunteers who are socially active. The Mobilization of Resources dimension is related to the synergy aspect of multi-stakeholder involvement which is able to provide community capacity development, mastery and understanding of technological information so that it can improve the quality of life. In the Satisfaction of Human Needs dimension, pragmatism in the government system often causes a loss of innovation and creativity in exploring local resources in society. In the context of health service policy, it is often not possible to explore the source of the main problems in society. The dimension of empowerment is the creation of knowledge. Knowledge is data and information combined with ability, intuition, experience, ideas, and motivation from competent sources. In the dimension of Change in Social Relations, social innovation is ultimately able to determine permanent changes in the social environment, power, relations between social groups, government, and society, the state and the private sector. These dynamics are related to those displayed in the triangle of vision, intention, development culture, identity, organizational and institutional dynamics. Meanwhile, in the Territorial Specificity dimension, the research results show that funding for poverty alleviation activities is assisted by CSR programs from industry as well as social assistance from various elements of society, such as institutions, individuals, companies, zakat institutions, foundations, volunteers and others. Research implications: This research has implications for the involvement of stakeholders in social innovation in overcoming the impacts of poverty Originality/value: The value of this research lies in the application of the social innovation dimension through the role of multi-stakeholders in overcoming the impacts of poverty. The research results also provide new value to the role of organic intellectuals which refers to actors who play an important role in society. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {The tourism industry is among the largest contributor to the Malaysian and Indonesian economies. Aggressive measures have been taken to boost both countries as a leader in the tourism sector. To sustain the growing tourism industry, the government would have to increase its spending. Due to restricted budgetary resources, one choice for reducing government spending is to utilize the waqf model as an alternative mechanism that can assist the government in reducing spending. Waqf also aims to fulfill the social needs of the community besides it is an innovative way to fund the tourism industry without relying on government funding. Thus, this study attempts to address whether the waqf model can help the government of Malaysia and Indonesia to sustain the tourism industry. This study adopts the qualitative approach, through semi-structured interviews was conducted to generate items for a survey. Next, for quantitative, data were collected using an online questionnaire survey to gain input from a broader population. The sampling procedure adopted was purposive sampling. The study found that the waqf model can be used to sustain the tourism industry as well as waqf model can help the government reduce expenditure for the tourism industry. The contributions from the findings can be used by both countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, to enhance the application of the waqf model in many sectors, including tourism. This certainly will have major impacts on the economy for both countries. Therefore, it ensures long-term economic operations that will benefit communities and socio-economic activities. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

The analysis was further conducted to expand the interpretation of gharimin in zakat institutions (ZI) to use the role of zakat distribution during the post-pandemic period due to income shock and long-term unemployment. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative research approach with grounded theory analysis to integrate theoretical insights into the interpretation of gharimin and current practices from the perspectives of ZI and IFI. An in-depth interview with 18 informants was conducted, and data were collected from senior management positions in the zakat distribution department, academicians who are experts in the area of zakat, and heads of Shariah departments in IFI. Findings: Expanding the interpretation of gharimin could help ZI and IFI recover the sustainability of gharimin for preparedness during post-pandemic and any emergency crisis in the future. Practical implications: This study implies the potential role of ZI in combating the risk of defaulting debtors in IFI to prepare for pandemic recovery in the future. Social implications: The new interpretation assists gharimin in reducing the burden debt using the zakat fund and protects genuine debtors by preventing IFI from declaring default or bankruptcy. Originality/value: This study narrows the literature gaps about gharimin in IFI in the context of the pandemic. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is, perhaps, the first paper to present the expansion of interpretation for gharimin into mu’sir in IFI in Malaysia. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study used a quantitative survey involving 250 ASNAF entrepreneurs in Malaysia to capture their diverse experiences. By using factor analysis, five factors were subsequently identified as key drivers for entrepreneurs’ success. These factors are record-keeping, capital, employees, marketing strategy, and online business. The anticipated findings of this research include a nuanced understanding of the factors driving ASNAF entrepreneurial success, contributing to both academic knowledge and practical implications for policymakers, financial institutions, and the ASNAF community.

Religion never differs between the rich and the poor, but the people who follow the religion will do, so as the fundamental thoughts, religion itself guides on the matter of removing the imbalance in religion in particular and society at large, for which we can find the taxing system in India. At the same time, Islam also proposes the idea of zakat to remove the gap between those who have and those who do not. To examine the idea of which the study was conducted by considering the Karnataka Zakat Trust of Mangaluru City of Karnataka state, as it is a donation that people are making out of their wealth. The information was gathered using a structured interview method, and for the remaining randomly selected 75 samples mail questionnaire was distributed, out of which 62 respondents responded to the study, so the total respondents of the study were 87 beneficiaries of Mangaluru City.

	abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, an investigation was conducted by collecting primary data from 379 household heads to examine the impact of social safety nets on household-level food security in the Torghar district of Northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The comprehensive analysis encompassed the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels. The bivariate analysis revealed issues and shortcomings related to access to social safety nets, particularly within the Zakat system. These issues included corruption and nepotism, which hindered poverty alleviation strategies and the well-being of vulnerable households. Additionally, complex bureaucratic procedures and regulations impeded social interventions, and political factors posed a substantial obstacle. At the multivariate level, the study identified the specific factors contributing to food insecurity. Respondents from extended family systems, individuals aged between 46 and 55 years, and those with religious education were found to be more vulnerable to food insecurity. While social safety nets held promise for addressing food sustenance challenges among local low-income citizens, the negative impacts of political involvement, favoritism, and nepotism were evident and required urgent attention. These findings emphasize the need for coordinated efforts among the government, social safety net officials, and community to identify and rectify these existing issues. Fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility regarding the role and implementation of social safety nets towards achieving food security is crucial to enhancing their viability and effectiveness, ensuring continuous support for those in need. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Zakāt on Agriculture, as one aspect of Islamic finance and philanthropy, is crucial in supporting community welfare and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This research examines the philanthropy movement driven by agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga in the Langkat Regency, Indonesia. It adopts a qualitative approach, employing a phenomenological study through in-depth interviews. This research involved three key groups as research subjects: 10 amil zakāt (who are responsible for zakāt administration), 15 zakāt payers, and 35 zakāt recipients. The research findings reveal that philanthropic activities involving agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga can be categorized into consumption-oriented and production-oriented activities. In contrast to the traditional approach of distributing zakāt mainly to relieve financial burdens, Desa Mangga has adopted a more proactive strategy in managing agricultural zakāt funds. The funds are directed towards productive businesses such as palm sugar production, stalls, and farmland management. As achieving complete economic independence continues, the effective allocation of agricultural zakāt funds at Desa Mangga progressively empower recipients to become more economically self-reliant. Nevertheless, it is crucial to highlight that, in practice, the concept of empowerment within zakāt philanthropy at Desa Mangga has yet to reach its full potential. Charitable activities still dominate the distribution of zakāt funds, inadvertently fostering dependency among zakāt recipients. © The Authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to develop cash waqf models for Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT), a special Islamic microfinance institution in Indonesia, combining Islamic social finance in Baitul Maal (house of wealth) division and Islamic commercial finance in Baitut Tamwil (house of asset development) division, as integrated Islamic social and commercial microfinance in Indonesia, to achieve triple bottom-line, including outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Delphi and analytic network process methods, with three groups of relevant respondents, including experts (academic), BMT practitioners and regulators. Findings: The results show that the best cash waqf model for BMT is “BMT as Nazir (waqf manager) and also as cash waqf receiver Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Penerima Wakaf Uang (LKSPWU)”, followed by “BMT Association as representative Nazir of several certified BMTs”. Moreover, “long-term investment deposit” is the best to account cash waqf in the BMT balance sheet. With regard to financing, the most preferred one is “financing to regular Micro and Small Enterprises” of BMT members. Research limitations/implications: Having allowed BMT to be Nazir (waqf manager), this research might only benefit Indonesian policymakers, such as the Financial Services Authority and the Ministry of Cooperatives, BMTs and the National Waqf Board. But it may also benefit other countries which have similar characteristics. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt several alternatives of best models in managing cash waqf most appropriate for their specific conditions. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help the social activities of the Baitul Maal through social cash waqf and, indirectly, by productive cash waqf. Originality/value: Studies have been limited, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study discussing the integrated cash waqf model, cash waqf account and cash waqf investment appropriate for BMT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study drew on scholarly publications including books and academic papers as well as primary sources about Imam Zarkasyi by utilizing a qualitative, descriptive, and explanatory research methodology. The findings revealed that Zarkasyi’s educational perspectives and personal experiences significantly influenced the modernization of the waqf-based educational system. Zarkasyi’s proposals to enhance the pondok system’s modernity were based on his thorough understanding of the country’s educational culture. In response to the Dutch colonial administration, private educational institutions were established in 1926. These institutions offered students, educators, and community members the chance to acquire essential life skills and values in a unique educational setting. To ensure the continuity of these institutions, Zarkasyi transformed them into publicly owned enterprises through waqf establishment in 1958. As a waqif, he allocated a substantial portion of his fortune to be shared collectively among his three brothers. Zarkasyi aimed to ensure the sustainability of this approach by incorporating waqf principles which include attitudes, abilities, and praiseworthy characteristics. His initiatives continue to serve as a pedagogical model for private schools in Indonesia. This success motivates others to emulate the waqf concept, thereby contributing to the restoration and development of Islamic civilization. © The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: Using judgemental sampling, a total of 275 waqifs participated in this work to identify their preference in donating their money to the facility should it is introduced. Using the developed waqf-based qardhul hassan scale (WAQASCALE), this study examined the preference accordingly. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS 27. Findings: The results obtained were as follows: the first factor considered by the waqifs in donating money was perceived household well-being, followed by perceived recipients’ welfare, perceived mankind benevolence and perceived Muslims’ community security. Research limitations/implications: The authors developed construct items that had generalisability issues as they were at the infancy stage of development among social finance scientists along with the narrow geographical constraint where the actual survey was conducted. Practical implications: The results were useful in giving new guidance to state governments and Islamic banks (IBs) in Malaysia to explore further this sort of facility for the improved well-being of those affected by COVID-19. Besides, sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as poverty, hunger and responsible consumption, among others can be addressed effectively for the mutual well-being of those affected by the health crisis in an effort of combating financial hardships in the meeting of basic needs, at least. The partnership between the state government and IBs could lead to the offered qardhul hassan financing-sourced funding from waqf for reduced financial hardships by needy and poor folks.

	abstract = {The Enactment of Islamic Religious Administration (State of Malacca) 2002 clearly stated that the Melaka Islamic Religious Council (MAIM) is responsible for organizing, planning and managing welfare matters of zakat beneficiaries for all asnaf groups. In fact, accumulated zakat would be distributed to specific groups (asnaf) for economic driven purposes, not just for short term, but also for long term economic purposes which is to enable these asnaf groups to break free from poverty domains. To date, communication promotion strategies regarding zakat collection and distribution in Melaka has been fruitful due to the increasing rate of zakat collection per year. Nonetheless, the question is how effective is the new media strategy done by MAIM in communicating and promoting information about zakat collection and activities within the Melaka areas? In fact, new media could have positive impacts such as promoting physical activities of zakat distribution to asnaf. Thus, this paper discusses how the zakat communication strategies conducted by MAIM through new media serve as a communication source in highlighting zakat management and distribution activities done by Zakat Melaka and MAIM. This study applies descriptive methods using qualitative approaches. Significantly, the data gleaned and the results of the study done would contribute towards providing clear cut information which could guide towards the improvement of zakat collection, distribution and administration for MAIM in future. © 2023 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The research aimed to evaluate the current growth and publication trends in Islamic social finance studies, identify the most prolific contributors in the field, determine the most highly cited documents, and explore the research gaps and implications for future research perspectives in Islamic social finance. Data were collected from the Scopus database using keywords such “Islamic Social Finance” OR “Zakat” OR “Sadaqah” OR “Islamic Microfinance” OR “Waqf” and OR “Qard al-Hasan”. A total of 1316 documents were initially obtained, and after screening, 732 documents were included for analysis. The data were analyzed using tools like Biblioshiny and Microsoft Excel. The results showed that most publications were in 2022 (106 publications). The most significant author, affiliation and source were Saad, R.A.J. by the author (16 articles), International Islamic University Malaysia by affiliation (153 articles), and Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research by the source (38 publications). This study found the article entitled; ‘‘Waqf, perpetual charity and poverty alleviation” written by Sadeq, A.M. (2022) as the most global cited document with 100 citations. Moreover, based on the results of thematic map and evolution, Islamic social finance research was divided into three main themes: Holistic Islamic Socio-Economic Empowerment, Impactful Islamic Finance Optimization, and Islamic Socio-Economic Advancement. This study highlighted the need for further studies across diverse contexts, inclusion of impact measurement and evaluation, comparative studies and optimization in Islamic microfinance, governance, compliance, and trust in zakat institutions, economic growth and Islamic finance, influences of religiosity and the pandemic on Islamic finance, policy, regulatory frameworks, and best practices. By addressing these gaps, researchers can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and effectiveness of Islamic social finance in addressing community well-being and poverty. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

	abstract = {Cash waqf is a form of contemporary waqf that has great potential in the modern world. In Indonesia, despite its potential of 180 trillion per year, cash waqf collection, management, and distribution are not optimal. Nonetheless, the infrastructure sector in Indonesia faces obstacles, particularly in terms of funding. The innovation of the CWLFRA (Cash Waqf Linked DINFRA) model is, therefore, a solution to these two issues, as the proposed model is the result of an integration between efforts to optimize cash waqf and infrastructure financing via the Infrastructure Investment Fund (DINFRA). In this CWLFRA innovation, waqf funds will be allocated to the mauquf 'alaih from the profits of infrastructure investment funds, which will become a source of long-term usable assets. As a result, the purpose of this academic paper is to develop a model capable of bolstering the ecosystem of Islamic social financial institutions and maximizing the potential achievement of cash waqf in Indonesia as a means of implementing sustainable finance and an effective instrument in reviving national economy through infrastructure development. In addition, this study seeks to determine the viability of the potential for developing the productivity of cash waqf in an effort to increase the effectiveness of achieving cash waqf to support economic sustainability with infrastructure potential. Nine respondents representing academicians and expert practitioners from both the waqf and infrastructure sectors filled out questionnaires to collect data. According to the results of the Delphi test, all respondents believed that there was a relationship between the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) indicators, indicating that this model is implementable. Moreover, based on the level of agreement of respondents, this model has the potential to contribute positively to national economic recovery, become a sustainable source of social funds, optimize the potential of waqf in Indonesia, strengthen the ecosystem of waqf social finance institutions, and improve the quality of management and maintenance of Indonesia's infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that integrating financial waqf with existing public infrastructure could positively affect the sustainability of national economic development. The novel aspect of this paper is the proposed cash waqf management system, which can serve as a useful reference for policymakers and waqf institutions seeking to develop a more effective waqf concept in terms of collection, administration, and distribution. Consequently, this study aims to demonstrate the potential for cash waqf, which can be integrated with DINFRA's product through the innovation of the CWL-FRA model, to become an investment instrument and offer a diversity of options to the waqf community. © The Author(s) (2023).},

	abstract = {Zakat is the third pillar of Islam, therefore a mandatory alms and one of the most important tools of Islamic finance that ensures wealth redistribution and is used to reduce poverty in Muslim societies. Infact, it is intended to provide for the immediate needs of the eight categories of eligible recipients as they are recognized in the Holy Quran in Surat Tawba verse 60. The capitalistic system automatically generates a serious disparity between the rich and the poor then try to reduce this gap indirectly through taxation whereas the Zakat directly reaches the neediest and diminished category. In fact, the goal of the Zakat is to transform the poor into Zakat givers by pulling them out of poverty. This will be examined through simulation with agent based modeling commonly known as ABM and will be applied using simulation tools NETLOGO Version 6.4p by introducing the Islamic concept that is Zakat to the model of Simple Economy previously developed by Wilensky and used by [1] and [2] to study the Impact of Zakat on a Social Wealth Distribution. Many cases are simulated with and without Zakat and by using the indicators like Gini index, Lorenz curve, we are able to conclude that a wealth distribution is more equal and the gap between the rich and the poor is less significant compared to when Zakat is not applied. © Little Lion Scientific.},

	abstract = {This study employs a basic qualitative approach, analyzing two case studies in which the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) is the sole trustee of legitimate state waqf assets. Is there a significant difference in the management of these two waqf hotels, as far as the organization that manages them? This study also explores the connection between waqf principles and hotel management, with a particular emphasis on the distribution of waqf benefits generated by the waqf hotel business. The goal is to investigate different perspectives on decision-making, challenges, and achievements in the sector. A semi-structured interview was conducted with two representatives from SIRC and one from Yayasan Wakaf Malaysia (YWM), both of whom manage waqf hotels. This research is guided by the principles of Fiqh Al-Awlawiyyat, which provides a thorough understanding of Islamic legal principles governing waqf and contemporary hotel management. Two waqf hotels have been chosen for a review of the management style and ownership structure using the criteria that have been established. Interview data was thematically analyzed to identify recurring patterns and gain valuable insights. Preliminary findings demonstrate the importance of community support for this waqf hotel to optimize profits. Muslims bear a great deal of responsibility if they understand that the money, they spend to stay at this waqf hotel is for the benefit of third parties in need of assistance. This study makes practical recommendations for improving the sustainability and effectiveness of waqf hotels; ongoing promotion and awareness should be prioritized. Muslims must understand that choosing a waqf hotel is a responsibility, not an option.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: A nationwide common malpractice in Zakat distribution has been prevailing in Bangladesh for the past few decades. The paper is a groundbreaking effort to investigate the perceptions of the Zakat payers about the common malpractices and to highlight whether any change in the conventional distribution of Zakat has occurred during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also aims to extract the common perception of the Zakat payers regarding the validity of the changed practices during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts the qualitative research approach allowing an in-depth interview technique based on an unstructured questionnaire schedule to obtain information from the Zakat payers, complemented by the key informant interview with the Islamic Scholars. The study obtained data from Zakat payers administering a purposive sampling technique based on two specified criteria. After coding the information on three main themes, content analysis is used to examine the results. Findings: The results reveal that although the Zakat payers dislike the common practices because of some antithetical issues, they still practice the same customs. Moreover, they apportion most of the value of Zakat in purchasing low-quality festive-motive clothes for the recipients. They are ignorant about Islamic law and the validity of such practices. According to scholars, these activities are not a pure system of Zakat provision and unable to alleviate poverty. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, this practice shifted heavily to buying food items for the poor due to the financial hurdles they confronted during the pandemic. Although no solid argument is deduced from the participants about the exactitude of such distributional change, scholars regard the transformation as beneficial to the afflicted and the impoverished who have been hit by the pandemic, as well as not conflicting with the Zakat legislation. Practical implications: The study is a novel contribution to addressing the malpractice in Zakat distribution through receiving practical information from the Zakat payers, which will help produce more in-depth research in Islamic finance. Furthermore, this research will help the government and people raise awareness about the authentic practices of Zakat distribution according to the codes of Shari’ah. Originality/value: This study is a pioneering investigation since a scarcity of scholarly works attempted to identify the impact of Covid-19 on the practice of Zakat distribution and the associated perception regarding its Islamic jurisprudence. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the investigation of common malpractices of Zakat is still unearthed by no former rigorous studies in the context of Bangladesh. The present study bridges this gap and paves a pragmatic research dimension in the Islamic finance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the potential of making Uzbekistan’s taxation system more inclusive by introducing a tax incentive policy related to zakat (obligatory Islamic alms for the wealthy). Additionally, it explores the establishment of relevant institutions to facilitate zakat collection and distribution. The study employs the method of comparative legal research, combined with exploratory research techniques, to examine taxation and zakat systems in different countries. The study’s findings indicate that incorporating zakat incentives, either in the form of tax credits or deductions, into Uzbekistan’s taxation system can enhance the role of zakat institutions in the country’s economy and reduce tax evasion to some extent. Moreover, it proposes a preliminary model of zakat management for Uzbekistan based on conclusions of the comparative study of various countries and analysis of the national legislation. Finally, the research highlights the necessity of a systematic approach to educate the public about zakat obligations, which is crucial for operation of proposed zakat management model and improving compliance. The study provides essential policy recommendations, including the implementation of zakat tax incentives, enhancing public zakat literacy, and ensuring the efficient operation of zakat institutions. By adopting these measures, the government of Uzbekistan can foster a more equitable and effective taxation system, contributing to socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. © 2024 by author(s).

	abstract = {Zakat can be allocated to help the poor establish a sustainable income. Recipients may receive zakat assistance in the form of both capital and job equipment, coupled with suitable training. Traditionally, zakat distribution has adhered to classical principles, involving monthly financial aid or limited working capital. However, this method is perceived as less effective in eradicating poverty. This study emphasises the significance of directing zakat towards income generation as a more impactful approach to poverty alleviation. To this end, this study explores classical and modern models of zakat disbursements for income generation, drawing from scholars’ perspectives in their respective eras. A qualitative approach for data collection and analysis was adopted based on the evidence from classical and modern literature. There are several methods of zakat disbursement for income generation, namely capital grants, loans, and training. Based on a survey of classical and modern literature, it was found that some classical scholars have granted such disbursements. Recognising the efficacy of this approach in helping zakat recipients, modern scholars are inclined to support income generation programs, including zakat loan provision. The evolution of this concept, coupled with its successful implementation, positions zakat as a key player in eradicating poverty among Muslims globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose — Agriculture is regarded as one of the most effective areas for alleviating poverty in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) nations. This study’s primary purpose is to present a novel integrated social and commercial financing model known as salam and muzāraʿah crowdfunding waqf (SMCW) model as a fundraising tool or as an alternative funding source for waqf organisations and agriculturalists. Design/Methodology/Approach — This qualitative research analysed the relevant literature on crowdfunding, cash waqf and agriculture, and the Islamic contracts of salam (forward sale) and muzāraʿah (sharecropping). Findings — With the synchronisation of all stakeholders in the agricultural sector, this study is projected to address the issue of inadequate land and funding and to foster innovation and inclusivity in Islamic financial products. The study suggests a practical funding alternative model for farmers that uses waqf institutions, crowdfunding and Islamic banks to alleviate poverty in OIC countries. Originality/Value — The proposed model takes a novel approach to developing a new financing option for farmers by fusing traditional Islamic finance principles with contemporary crowdfunding platforms. It provides an ethical and sustainable financing option based on Islamic values and addresses the issues faced by small farmers in the OIC.Research Limitations/Implications — The proposed research has significant implications for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, the Islamic finance industry, crowdfunding platforms, and Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority countries. It offers a new financing option based on ethical and sustainable principles that can support the expansion and development of the agricultural sector. Thus, this study enriches the literature on waqf, crowdfunding and Islamic financing. Future researchers may examine a model integrating waqf, crowdfunding and Islamic contracts that target other sectors. Practical Implications — The study’s practical benefits stem from its potential to address the problems of inadequate land and funding while fostering innovation and inclusivity in Islamic financial products, ultimately assisting in the reduction of poverty in the agricultural sector in OIC countries. It does this by fusing traditional Islamic finance principles with modern crowdfunding platforms. © 2024, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA). All rights reserved.},

Waqf Core Principles is an initiative effort that aims to provide a description of the position and role of waqf management and supervision systems in economic development programs and as a methodology on the core principles of management and supervision. This research uses a qualitative approach. Data were obtained from waqf managers in Islamic boarding schools in Bangkalan Regency, targeting effective waqf management in Waqf Core Principals, using componential analysis with Atlas.ti. The research findings show that the practice of waqf in Islamic boarding schools in Bangkalan Regency is more of a formal practice as a requirement for obtaining assistance and the like, including the waqf management structure revolving around close family circles, while in terms of supervision, the government is passive in waiting if there are problems and adjusting the budget in socialization and supervision activities. Building awareness of the utilization of waqf assets can be done through structured counseling through existing instructors in each sub-district by building synergies with pesantren, as educational, religious and social institutions that are trusted to be at the forefront and pilot of waqf development. © 2024, State Islamic University of Ar-Raniry Faculty of Sharia and Law.

To achieve this aim, it examined the changes in the socio-economic status of beneficiaries before and after the program. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts the convergent parallel mixed method design. It conducted two surveys to micro-entrepreneurs: the first is when they received the loan and the second is when they finished their installments. In addition to the longitudinal data obtained from these two surveys, qualitative data were collected by participant observation and interview technique with visiting these people periodically throughout the interest-free loan (qard al-hasan). Findings: According to the results obtained from the analysis of the pre- and post-surveys, a statistically significant increase of 35% was experienced in the monthly household income after receiving the qard al-hasan loan compared to before. Similarly, a statistically significant increase was found in the monthly expenditures of 23 out of 30 households after receiving the qard al-hasan. Originality/value: There are two originalities of this study. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first research that examines the only Islamic microfinance program in Turkey. Second, it uses longitudinal data while examining the impact of Islamic microfinance on the welfare of the poor.

	abstract = {Poverty is an apparent problem in Indonesia, with the number of people living in poverty reaching 26.36 million. Islamic Social Finance (ISF), especially through productive waqf instruments, is one of the prospective solutions to overcome this problem. Although Indonesia has enormous waqf potential, waqf realisation is still very low. There are several challenges in the waqf collection process, namely low literacy or public awareness, unprofessional management, and a lack of qualified human resources (nazhir). This research aims to determine the optimal productive waqf model to be implemented in Indonesia using the Delphi ANP-BOCR method. To strengthen the research results, this study also conducted a meta-analysis as a form of robustness check and a benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) analysis of each model as supporting arguments. The findings of this study show that Islamic banks as a way to leverage funds for waqf are the most prioritised model. This is because Islamic banks act as intermediary institutions that have great potential for optimising the collection and management of waqf funds, which can increase economic growth. This is reinforced by the results obtained from the meta-analysis and several supporting arguments, which show that Islamic financial institutions (including Islamic banks) can improve community welfare through the utilisation of social funds (including waqf). Besides that, this research also discusses an alternative model of productive waqf through digitalisation by adopting several technologies that aim to increase efficiency, transparency, and accessibility so as to optimise the collection and management of waqf funds more effectively and efficiently. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Exploring the current phenomenon of the cash waqf-linked sukuk (CWLS) program issuance that involves Islamic banks in Indonesia, this paper aims to investigate the key barriers and intentional behaviors in realizing wealthy Muslims’ contribution to the program using the intermediary function of Islamic banks. Moreover, this study provides a conceptual framework to set effective marketing strategies to encourage wealthy Muslims to become cash waqf founders and sustain their contribution. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study used a literature review and in-depth interviews to generate insights for developing a model of wealthy Muslims’ behavior toward cash waqf programs held by Islamic banks. Findings: The study identified low trust, literacy and transparency as the biggest barriers to cash waqf contributions, but suggests that a greater role for Islamic banks, personal engagement and innovative product offerings can help to overcome these barriers. The study also identified three new behavioral dimensions that are important for understanding wealthy Muslims’ contributions to cash waqf: personal financial planning, accountability and political issues. Based on these findings, the study proposes 10 strategies for all stakeholders to pursue in the short and medium term to promote cash waqf contributions from wealthy Muslims. Research limitations/implications: This study only involved respondents from three major cities in Indonesia: Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya because these cities have a large number of wealthy Muslims. Future research can collect more samples from all major cities in Indonesia or other Muslim majority countries, and use other qualitative methodology such as phenomenological, ethnographic, grounded theory, case study or action research. The findings of this study can be the starting point for further research and the proposed conceptual framework requires empirical testing in the future. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be a basis for policymakers and the Islamic financial industry in formulating marketing, education and socialization strategies for innovative cash waqf programs. Social implications: The findings of this study will support the acceleration of cash waqf collection for cash waqf initiatives through Islamic banks. Moreover, with a better understanding of the factors impeding and motivating the most potential Muslim groups to contribute to the innovative cash waqf program, the ultimate goal of higher national socio-economic development becomes more attainable. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate wealthy Muslims’ behavioral factors for contributing to innovative cash waqf held by Islamic banks, from various stakeholder perspectives. It fills a research gap in the literature on innovative cash waqf and behavior. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The idea is to explore whether diversification impacts MFIs' financial performance and outreach differ for Islamic microfinance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors test the effect of diversification and business models of MFIs on their performance and poverty outreach. The authors’ data set is an unbalanced panel sample of 81 (Islamic and conventional) MFIs in MENA countries covering 1999–2018, comprising 743 MFI-year observations. Findings: The authors find that increasing income diversification in microfinance and focusing on rural areas decreases the financial performance of MFIs in MENA countries. Islamic MFIs benefit from income diversification by increasing their financial performance. The results provide evidence of a nonlinear relationship between income diversification and the financial performance of MFIs. Although conventional MFIs improve their depth of outreach by diversifying their income, Islamic MFIs have a lower breadth of outreach because they show a higher degree of income diversification. Practical implications: This research contributes to the ongoing debate of whether MFIs should focus on or diversify their services to Islamic microfinance. Therefore, the findings of this study are practically crucial for MFIs' stakeholders to understand the contribution of diversification strategies in improving the Islamic MFIs to achieve both financial and social objectives. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first research that addresses the impact of diversification strategies in Islamic microfinance. Additionally, using a panel data set of conventional and Islamic MFIs in MENA countries spanning 1999–2018, this study provides empirical evidence on the diversification versus focus issue from the microfinance industry and the subset of Islamic microfinance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A quantitative survey was employed to collect data from 298 Malaysian specialists using questionnaires on a 289-5th point Likert scale. The study utilized Smart-PLS 4.0 and SEM-PLS for the analysis of the data. The analysis revealed that digital accounting adoption was found to significantly and positively influence corporate sustainability. Integration of digital Zakat was also shown to have a substantial positive impact on corporate sustainability, aligning philanthropy with sustainability goals and enhancing overall corporate sustainability outcomes. Moreover, financial transparency was confirmed to play a crucial moderating role in strengthening the relationships between digital practices and corporate sustainability. Financial transparency positively influences corporate sustainability efforts by providing stakeholders with clear insights into a company's financial commitment to sustainability initiatives. This paper offers practical insights into the interconnected dynamics of digital accounting adoption, financial transparency, corporate sustainability, and digital Zakat integration. The findings of this study offer valuable practical implications for both scholars and practitioners in the fields of digital accounting and corporate sustainability, enhanced corporate sustainability through digital accounting adoption, and integrating digital zakat for sustainable philanthropy. By heeding these implications, both scholars and practitioners can work towards more responsible and sustainable business practices, fostering a positive impact on society and the environment while also building trust and confidence among stakeholders. © 2024 AESS Publications.

It primarily examines the role of these digital modalities in enhancing philanthropic contributions, improving financial transparency, and achieving sustainability goals. The study explores the synergistic effects of combining digital accounting and digital zakat, and aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding their collective impact on sustainable business practices. The results confirm the primary hypothesis and show a positive correlation with corporate sustainability. Consistent with previous research, digital zakat is identified as a catalyst for stakeholder engagement and a facilitator of sustainable development initiatives. Similarly, digital accounting is associated with increased financial transparency, thereby strengthening corporate sustainability efforts. These findings underscore the need for further exploration and integration into corporate strategies and highlight the prospects of digital technology in strengthening corporate sustainability. The study provides strategic recommendations for businesses, policymakers, and academics to promote sustainable practices and align financial systems with broader sustainability goals. This research is central to deepening the understanding of digital technologies' ability to enhance sustainability in business contexts, and future studies should extend these findings to examine the complex dynamics of how digital solutions can optimize sustainability in different sectors and settings. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Most People’s Religious Schools (Sekolah Agama Rakyat-SAR) face financial constraints in managing and administering schools. Therefore, SAR administrators strive to obtain funds through instruments such as waqf, for example, cash waqf. However, until now, the implementation of cash waqf instruments in SAR has not received much attention among SAR administrators. Nevertheless, Sekolah Rendah Islam Tahfiz Integrasi Al-Fateh, Raub, Pahang (SRITI, Al-Fateh) is one of the SARs that has implemented cash waqf and has had a positive impact on the school’s development. The objective of this study is to identify the method of implementing cash waqf and to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation in sustaining the finances of Al-Fateh Integrated Tahfiz Islamic Primary School (SRITI), Raub, Pahang, Malaysia. This is a qualitative study. A face-to-face interview was carried out as a data collection method using semi-structured questions involving three respondents comprising the chairperson, a local officer, and a project manager of SRITI Al-Fateh. The study data was supported by secondary sources such as books, magazines, journals, articles, and others. The data obtained was analyzed using the content analysis method. The study outcome finds that SRITI Al-Fateh has collected waqf in the form of cash. The funds collected came from various groups of the society such as individuals and NGOs. From the funds, a two-story school building was successfully constructed, and a mosque (still being constructed), and they serve as an activity center for teachers and students. This study hopes that the method of implementation of cash waqf by SRITI Al-Fateh can serve as guidance for SAR in Malaysia and other educational institutions in the effort to sustain the school finances. Future work can be done by making comparisons with one or more other SARs to show the effectiveness of cash waqf implementation. © (2024), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah). All rights reserved.},

Apparently, although Indonesian population is dominated by Muslim, the literacy of waqf is still considerably moderate, that waqf is widely known limited for masjid, school, and cemetery, while it can be utilized empower the community's economic condition. The purpose of this activity is to increase the literacy of rural communities on waqf and its use for community economic empowerment. Community service activities were carried out in Cipelang Village, Cijeruk District, Bogor Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia. Activities were conducted in the form of socialization and discussion in a hybrid manner, a combination of offline and online activities. Offline activities were supported by the village community. University students organized the Community Services Program at the Cipelang Village. The online activities were arranged by lecturer team from IPB University, Bogor. The results of the socialization program showed that only view people were aware with waqf and its use in real economy, even though most of them familiar with waqf terminology. The waqf socialization to the community made the community more aware of waqf and its use, including for community economic empowerment. The community also hoped to have the opportunity to use waqf funds for their economic empowerment, including for the development of Muslim friendly (halal) tourism, considering that in Cipelang Village prevails many traditional Islamic boarding schools. Therefore, further action to gather the waqf funds for empowering the potential is needed. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: The unique institution of waqf that was ignored during the colonization of the Muslim areas has to be revived to play its role in shared growth, social inclusion and cohesion in society. This research paper aims to explore the role of waqf as an instrument for a sustainable growth system and to suggest a model for socioeconomic development in an economy like that of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research is based on analytical methods to arrive at the frameworks and a model that could facilitate the revival of waqf for community development/social inclusion in economies like that of Pakistan. Findings: As most of the OIC member states like Pakistan are facing serious financial problems due to debt servicing obligations, promoting Waqf for various socioeconomic and cultural functions is a vital requirement for such economies. The inability of the state institutions in providing necessary civic, health and education facilities to the public is causing serious harm to the balance of the society. It requires promoting a formal system of charity and using FinTech for waqf-based donations and financing the micro businesses. The perpetuity complimented by the profitability of the waqf properties makes the waqf institutions sustainable and effective when compared to individual charities. Research limitations/implications: This is conceptual research discussing the potential of waqf in light of its historical role. Researchers may undertake empirical studies on awqaf operations in various jurisdictions and their role in the empowerment of the poor. Practical implications: The research will provide the researchers with insight into the potential of waqf as a tool for community development. Besides, it will enable policymakers and implementation authorities to socialize charity for sustained benefits and welfare. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first major research that discusses the role of waqf in economies facing budgetary and trade deficits in the eradication of poverty and the promotion of social and economic entrepreneurship in realizing the community development targets for the economies like that of Pakistan. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It combines Islamic principles with environmental conservation, as being waqf assets, a forest is prohibited from being sold, given, or inherited. An effective management strategy is crucial to ensure waqf-based forest productivity and sustainability. Some research has already been conducted, but the specific dimension remains unexplored. This study aims to identify essential aspects and effective management strategies to escalate waqf-based forest benefits. Using a comprehensive approach, this study combines a literature study, in-depth interviews, and a study case in Bogor Waqf Forest, Bogor Regency, Indonesia. The findings were analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and further in-depth interviews as the validation process. There are six important considerations to optimize waqf-based forest management: legal, ecological, Islamic, economical, social, and aesthetic. The land’s legal status as waqf assets is recognized as the most crucial aspect to avoid possible conflict and sustainability in the future. Then, the following considerations are improved ecological and Islamic activities aspects, economic strategies, and social and aesthetic consecutively. This research is expected to provide a deeper investigation of the future management strategies for waqf-based forests. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The southern region of Thailand is the region with the highest proportion of impoverished people in the country, particularly in the southern border provinces in which the majority of the population profess Islam. Due to the ineffective and outdated data collection of poor people by the government, resulting in the reliability of the collected data is low. As a result, even those who are no longer living in poverty may still be included in the database of needy people, while many truly impoverished people who are not included in the database do not receive proper assistance from the government. This paper presents an effective and reliable method for collecting data on impoverished Muslims by utilizing data of the annual zakat recipients, collected by the mosque committee. In addition, this paper proposes a mobile application that can search for information, pinpoint locations, and provide navigation to needy Muslims in order to facilitate public and private-sector agencies as well as charitable organizations in assisting them. Furthermore, the system analysis and design as well as the functionalities of the application are also presented. The Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score is used as an index to measure user satisfaction with the application. The respondents are asked to provide their opinion using a 5-point Likert scale. The assessment results reveal that IT experts and the sample users involved in the aid and welfare of low-income people are highly satisfied with the interface, performance, and functionality of the application with the CSAT score of 95% (x̄ = 4.36, S.D.= 0.59) and 83.21% (x̄ = 4.16, S.D.= 0.69) respectively. © 2024, Success Culture Press.

	abstract = {Zakat is one of the pillars of Islam and is considered an instrument that can potentially contribute to the economic development of the Muslim community in Indonesia. However, the current system and management of zakat have not been able to minimize the gap between the potential zakat that exists and the actual zakat that can be collected. This paper aims to examine zakat in its position as fiqh al-ibadat (Islamic jurisprudence of worship) and the consequences of its limited application, if not non-existent. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to complement existing literature by proposing a new solution to the problem of zakat. This empirical legal study employed the maqaşid al-shari'ah (objectives of Islamic law) approach. Data were collected by means of interview and literature review from relevant journal articles, books, and websites. The results of the study revealed that there is a need to reposition zakat from fiqh al-ibadat to fiqh muamalat. This will allow for more flexible zakat management that will have a maximum impact on the welfare of the Muslim community. Therefore, it can be argued that from the perspective of maqaşid al-shari'ah, zakat is not only an act of worship related to the purification of wealth, but more than that, zakat can also be an instrument to promote the welfare and economic development of society if it is managed effectively and properly. The change in meaning and paradigm is significant to ensure that the maqaşid al-shari'ah can be achieved effectively. © 2024 Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry. All rights reserved.},

In addition, antecedents to attitude, namely, religiosity, level of knowledge, perception of fairness and self- efficacy, were also examined, resulting in eight hypotheses of the study. Design/methodology/approach: This research used an online survey questionnaire. Respondents are waqf stakeholders comprising of donors, beneficiaries, waqf managers, activists, volunteers and the community. A total of 198 usable responses were analysed using SmartPLS version 3.0. Findings: The research model explains 57.5% of the intention to accept the benefidonors concept. Six hypotheses were accepted, which includes attitude, subjective norms and perceived behaviour control to accept the concept; perception of fairness to attitude; and self-efficacy and facilitating resources to PBC. Research limitations/implications: The study looks at six groups of waqf stakeholders but could not distinctly categorize the stakeholders into groups because of their multiple roles. Future studies can examine each of the different group. Practical implications: Waqf institutions should improve their efforts to encourage beneficiaries and donors to become benefidonors such as having an online platform and providing training for waqf stakeholders. Social implications: Benefidonors can help uplift the poverty level of the less privileged, reduce cost of service and thus assist to reduce the gap of income inequality in the community. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first empirical study that examines the intention of Waqf stakeholders to accept the benefidonors concept. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As the largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has thrived and undergone some legal and programmatic revolutions to promote social justice through Islamic philanthropy. However, this study demonstrates that the rapid growth of charitable crowdfunding in the last decade has some impacts on the social justice trajectory of Islamic philanthropy, particularly in the areas of inclusivity, sustainability, and governance. This study draws from the case of Kitabisa, the largest crowdfunding platform in Indonesia, by conducting interviews with the founders and users and observing their online interactions on the platform and social media. This study also collects data on Muslim philanthropic Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that actively used Kitabisa to raise funds, with special attention to Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT), one of Indonesia’s largest Muslim philanthropic NGOs. This study found that the trend of crowdfunding has amplified the inclusive space in Indonesian philanthropy where Muslim NGOs actively provide social services and enact collaborations with non-Muslims. However, through crowdfunding, Muslim NGOs have become more accommodating toward short-term social programs or ‘charity’. The crowdfunding trend has also raised accountability and transparency issues in Indonesian philanthropy. This study argues that the broader involvement of grassroots actors, either individuals or informal communities, through crowdfunding explains its impacts on Indonesian Islamic philanthropy’s trajectory for social justice. © (2024), (SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies).

SmartPLS was used to assess the structure and measurement model of three hundred thirty samples.

The survey was conducted from March 2022 until January 2023, still very much affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the study reveal significant dimensions of deprivation experienced by the poor and destitute asnaf in Kuala Lumpur, which were not sufficiently captured by previous assessments. In addition to the headcount and intensity of the poverty experienced, the study captures the dimensions and indicators that contribute to the poverty scenario of the poor and destitute asnaf in Kuala Lumpur. Consequently, zakat institutions are recommended to integrate non-monetary poverty indicators into their assessments to obtain a rigorous framework to address poverty-related issues and the factors that affect the well-being of the poor and destitute asnaf households in Malaysia. The results bring wide ramifications for casting the poverty net more exhaustively than before but also for identifying the indicators that the poor and destitute are most vulnerable to. In light of the findings, it is critical that future programmes that are designed address the non-pecuniary dimensions of poverty so that zakat resources are allocated effectively. © 2024, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {The young Muslim generation’s embracing digital platforms for Zakat payments represents a dynamic fusion of enduring religious values with the modern digital landscape, heralding a new era in Islamic charitable practices. This trend illustrates a profound transformation within the Islamic world, where the pillars of faith are being reimagined and revitalized through the lens of technological advancement. The present study delved into the factors influencing the young Muslim generation’s preference for digital platforms in Zakat transactions across Indonesia and Malaysia. We examined variables such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Trust, Zakat Literacy, and Digital Infrastructure, aiming to discern their impact on the propensity for digital Zakat contributions with the extension of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The research encompassed a diverse sample of 382 participants and utilized advanced methodologies, specifically Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS Multi Group Analysis (PLS-MGA), for rigorous data analysis. The results indicated that Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Digital Infrastructure, and Zakat Literacy notably influenced the use of digital platforms for Zakat. Furthermore, PLS-MGA uncovered significant cross-country differences where Digital Infrastructure showed a more pronounced positive impact in Malaysian context, whereas Social Influence had a greater effect in Indonesia. These findings offer critical insights into the young Muslim community’s digital engagement for religious financial obligations, underscoring the need for tailored digital Zakat solutions that cater to the unique preferences of this demographic. This research not only enriches the understanding of digital adoption in religious practices but also challenges the notion of a universal approach, advocating for context-specific strategies in the realm of digital religious financial services. Future researchers are suggested to consider longitudinal investigations as well as examining cross-regional contexts in this realm of research. © 2024 by author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose — This study aims to discuss several examples of temporary Islamic endowments (waqfs) in the modern period, arguing that jurists and Muslim endowment managers should utilise them more widely to adjust to current societal circumstances and open the door for new ways of caring for those in need. Design/Methodology/Approach — It employed textual analysis of legal opinions related to temporary waqfs, outlining the positions of scholars on both sides of the issue, including a presentation and analysis of their evidence. Findings — The research findings show that temporary waqfs are an essential means of renewable and sustainable economic support, where wealthy people endow their money for religious gain and to help others in need. Originality/Value — Unlike some previous studies, this article specifically examines modern and contemporary forms of temporary endowments and demonstrates some of their effects in supporting the economy and the needy in society. Practical Implications — Following this paper’s recommendations, those with funds and everyone who can create an endowment should support endowment institutions in modern ways and in different areas of temporary endowments, which would be very beneficial in eliminating poverty and supporting the economy. Research Limitations/Implications — Due to the limited scope of the study, its findings are limited to contemporary jurisprudential issues related to temporary endowments. Hence, it is related to the Islamic economy and steps for strengthening it in Muslim societies. © Moath Alnaief, Kotb Rissouni, Reda Ibrahim Abdelgalil and Maryam Almansoori.

This study explores the role of Islamic financial instruments in facilitating investments that not only prioritise financial returns but also social and environmental outcomes. The method used is Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) to analyse time series data from 2015 to 2023. The research variables used are Islamic investment, musyarakah financing and Islamic microfinance. The results showed that musyarakah financing has a significant influence on the growth of Islamic investment, thus contributing to poverty alleviation (SDG 1) and increasing financial inclusion (SDG 8). In addition, Islamic microfinance is proven to be effective in empowering the local economy and creating jobs. These findings confirm the importance of Islamic finance integration in sustainable development strategies and offer innovative solutions to complex global challenges. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {Purpose: The potential of waqf is so great in Indonesia but has not been optimized. This paper aims to offer a model for waqf institutions to adopt financial technology for developing productive and social waqf. The authors cunduct an assesment of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) in seeing to the crowdfunders’ behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a structural equation using the partial least square approach to test the hypotheses. Based on purposive sampling, the spread of questionnaires through online surveys throughout Indonesia consists of all islands. A total of 297 respondents collected the questionnaires. Findings: Based on the findings, acceptance models have a positive and significant impact on the behavioral intentions of crowdfunders, while Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology have no significant effect. Research limitations/implications: The sample of this study involved potential crowdfunders from all over the islands in Indonesia, but these results cannot be generalized because of limitations in terms of the sampling technique used. However, the results of this study can be used as an illustration of how crowdfunders behave in donating money using financial technology. Practical implications: The results of this study provide a comprehensive perspective for policymakers, especially the Indonesian Waqf Board as the waqf authority that regulates waqf nazir to improve quality by adopting crowdfunding financial technology in collecting waqf funds. In addition, in terms of implications for the government, this waqf crowdfunding model will reduce spending and increase economic growth. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in looking at the waqf crowdfunding in Indonesia by looking at two reliable technology determinant models. Studies on cash waqf in Indonesia are many, but they do not look at the issue of crowdfunding, which has gained more attention recently. This paper aims to fill this gap, and this becomes the novelty. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the performance of ISF in Indonesia, both in terms of collection and management, is still far from expectations. To address this problem, a digital transformation of ISF is needed by leveraging technologies that come with both advantages and disadvantages. This study employs a Delphi ANP-BOCR analysis to determine the most optimal technology for ISF digitalization, which result is supported by meta-analysis findings. The result shows that cloud computing is the most optimal technology when only benefits and costs are evaluated. When all factors, including benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, are considered, digital platform proves to be the most optimal technology for both the short and long term. BOCR analysis also confirms that digital platform and cloud computing are the most optimal technology. Meta-analysis further supports the contribution of digital platform in improving social finance performance. To optimize the implementation of ISF digitalization in Indonesia, this study provides an alternative model that incorporates multiple technologies. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.},

	abstract = {Purpose — This study aims to examine the extent to which halal branding and digital media utilisation affect consumer behaviour. It also intends to provide an overview of the sociopreneurship model—a model that targets both financial and social benefits, while also working to solve problems in the community—to empower micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through the use of halal branding and digital media managed by zakat institutions. Design/Methodology/Approach — In the first stage, this study employs a quantitative approach to analyse the factors of digital use and halal branding in influencing consumer behaviour. In this respect, multiple linear regression was used to analyse 172 research respondents. In the second stage, it uses a qualitative approach in designing a sociopreneurship model based on the results of the first stage. Findings — This study found that religiosity and halal branding have a positive and significant effect on Muslim interest in buying halal products. In addition, the factors of price, religiosity and halal branding also positively and significantly affect satisfaction in consuming halal products. The sociopreneurship model can be applied to zakat institutions to facilitate MSMEs in developing product quality through halal branding and digital utilisation. Originality/Value — The unique characteristic of this study lies in the use of both the quantitative and qualitative approaches in carrying out this research. It is hoped that the model offered in this study will be able to develop the MSME sector to keep abreast of modern trends despite the limited capital available to such institutions. Research Limitations/Implications — The sample used in this study was restricted to Indonesia, with a limited number of respondents. Moreover, data collection was conducted through questionnaires without in-depth interviews with consumers, MSMEs and zakat institutions. Practical Implications — The zakat institution’s scheme or model of sociopreneurship will be beneficial for the modern development of MSMEs even though they possess limited capital. Zakat institutions provide three types of assistance: 1) direct monitoring that starts from production inputs to the production process and which continues to the distribution process to ensure that the products developed by the fostered MSMEs are truly halal; 2) assistance at the digital marketing stage; and 3) assistance in accessing loan funds under qarḍ ḥasan (benevolent loans) schemes. Social Implications — This research has a social impact on the development of MSMEs through the implementation of the concept of sociopreneurship. In this case, MSME actors who are classified as donation recipients can turn into donors, which would assist in reducing poverty levels. Therefore, social and business benefits will be achieved through the modern development of MSMEs. © Siti Nur Azizah, Annisa Nur Salam and Ahmad Zaenal Arifin.},

However, the under-collection issue has been characterizing the cash waqf movement globally. This study aims to examine how understanding the distinct cash waqf donating behavior across different generations has the potential to address the problem. Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the theory of planned behavior by adding religiosity and knowledge variables into the standard model, using the partial least square structural equation modeling. A survey is conducted on 684 respondents representing the main provinces in Indonesia and four major generations (Baby Boomers [BB], Generations X, Y and Z). Findings: Religiosity, Knowledge, Attitude, Subjective Norms and Perceived Behavioral Control directly or indirectly affect cash waqf intention. The effect is contingent on the characteristics of generations. Research limitations/implications: This study covers only the Indonesian case with limited coverage of the more heterogeneous provinces in the country. The sample distribution for BB can also be enlarged. Practical implications: Cash waqf institutions (government and private) should apply the dynamic segmenting strategy, where the diversification of the promotion, marketing, awareness and approaches are contingent on the different characteristics of each generation.

Design/methodology/approach: A series of interviews with four waqf officers who are involved with waqf reporting process from four different waqf institutions in Malaysia were conducted. Findings: The findings show a number of reasons for the current weak waqf reporting practices including the absence of standardised waqf reporting standards, no reporting or disclosure awareness by the waqf management, limited reporting channels from the state authorities to the national authorities, diversification in the governance structure and reluctance of waqf administration to disclose waqf reporting. The findings also identified several factors contributing to good waqf reporting practices. This includes leadership, good cultural setting within the institution, political will as a push factor, limited qualified personnel as well as sustainability issues and finally, the visibility of the waqf report itself.

	abstract = {The use of structured query formulation languages is a method for gaining access to data in information management systems. Writing structured queries is a powerful method of data retrieval, and end users can generate complex database queries by becoming proficient in a particular query language. Digitization of database information systems, history and endowment, and technology conservation are some examples of database conservation techniques in the process of displaying data that require optimal query techniques. Historical and endowment properties comply with a certain set of laws governing waqf recipients, which sets them apart from heritage and cultural assets. Trusted property typically comprises real estate, valuables, or both and has an infinite preservation term so long as it may still be put to use. A solid information technology infrastructure is essential for ensuring comprehensive data security. Given the availability of knowledge and the quick development of information technology, ensuring its sustainability is a challenge. This research is aimed at preserving historical and waqf databases based on the case study of the Kingdom of Sumedang Larang (KSL), Indonesia, through examination of the database, synchronization of digital data with physical data, as well as looking at its relationship with organizations and management. The proposed method, namely the Design and Analysis of Database Query Model for Preservation Information System (DAQMP), creates a recurring query model from the original tabular data placed in the next table as a special table check for data specifications containing important data. The results must be accurately aligned between digital and physical records regularly to serve as a record of any changes and as evidence to determine whether data has been corrupted, altered, or lost. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite being a Muslim-dominated country, Bangladesh has widely embraced traditional microfinance since its inception in the mid-1970s. However, Islamic microfinance, which has a lot to offer to the poor, is still in its infancy and has yet to gain momentum in the country. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the importance of Islamic microfinance and propose alternative Shariah-compliant microfinance models in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the desk research method, which relies on existing literature to collect secondary data on key concerns of traditional microfinance programs. In addition, institutional-level secondary data were also collected from the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) of Bangladesh. Guided by the Maqasid-al-Shariah, this study then proposes several Islamic microfinance models to overcome selected challenges faced by the microfinance industry in Bangladesh. Findings: This study suggested three composite Shariah-compliant microfinance models, which are likely to help the underprivileged and thus ensure the achievement of the sustainable development goals in Bangladesh. The first model explained how the operational strategy of incumbent microfinance institutions (MFIs) could be restructured, while the second proposed the organizational strategies for establishing a new MFI. The third model used the notion of Sadaqah (charity) to address the multiple borrowing issues of the industry. Meanwhile, the successful transformation of the conventional microfinance industry to an Islamic one is dependent on the effective collaboration between the regulatory authorities, practitioners and MFIs. Originality/value: Albeit the paucity of literature on the topic, the findings of this study will guide policymakers/practitioners in designing relevant microfinance models to help transform conventional microfinance into Islamic microfinance in Bangladesh. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Employing a multi-method qualitative research approach, the study integrateds qualitative insights from a comprehensive literature review and a comprehensive qualitative analysis through the grounded theory method, underpinned by principles of Islamic finance and contemporary financial innovation. The findings revealed that the proposed cash waqf model leveraged communal wealth for long-term developmental projects, ensuring sustainability and adherence to Islamic jurisprudence. The study concludes with the establishment of a specialized waqf institution to manage these funds, advocating for transparency and accountability to foster trust and a culture of philanthropy. The proposed model not only holds significant potential for transforming the economic landscape of Indonesia’s new capital but also offers a blueprint for integrating Islamic philanthropic principles with modern financial strategies, setting a precedent for similar initiatives globally. The research contributes to create a practical and sustainable financial framework that aligns with Indonesia’s cultural context and Islamic generosity traditions, facilitating infrastructure development and economic growth. © 2024, Universiti Teknologi Mara.

The research applied quantitative analysis method by distributing questionnaires to collect primary data from 111 mustahiq recipients of assistance from zakat institutions. This research employed a path analysis technique with the help of the SEM-PLS (Partial Least Squares) 4.0 program and was used to analyze the influence among variables. The empirical findings indicate that the productive zakat program significantly and positively affects mustahiq's welfare but not the business’s success. Meanwhile, entrepreneurial motivation and competence also significantly and positively affect business success and mustahiq welfare. Interestingly, the success factor for Islamic businesses can mediate the relationship between productive zakat, motivation, and competency on the welfare of mustahiq. This research contributes to the zakat literature by examining the connection between productive zakat, entrepreneurial drive, competency, and the factors influencing the performance of Islamic enterprises in achieving welfare according to Islamic objectives. Practically, the implications of this research are useful for the government as a policymaker in increasing the contribution of zakat institutions to material and spiritual poverty alleviation. © 2024, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: A key objective of zakat institutions is to distribute funds efficiently and effectively. Despite its critical role in alleviating poverty, the distribution of zakat appears to have been overlooked by previous studies. Recognising such a gap, this study examines the distribution priorities of zakat funds in Malaysia. Design/Methodology/Approach: Our study relies upon secondary data on the distribution of zakat funds between 2007 and 2015. We analyse the data using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique (pair-wise technique analysis), which involves ranking zakat recipients and comparing them across all states in Malaysia. Research findings: This study demonstrates that zakat funds were distributed to beneficiaries as mentioned in the Quran: hardcore poor (fakir), poor (miskin), zakat operator (amil), inclined to Islam (muallaf), slave (riqab), debtors (gharimin) wayfarer (fisabilillah) and stranded in path (Ibnu Sabil). The poverty groups and wayfarers were the top priority of Malaysian zakat institutions. Meanwhile, debtors, slaves, and those stranded in path were given the least importance. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study addresses the gap in the zakat literature by adding empirical evidence on the zakat distribution practices amongst all states in Malaysia in remedying the long-standing issue of poverty. The output of this study contributes to enhancing society’s understanding of the role of zakat institutions in combating poverty in Malaysia. Practitioner/Policy implication: A clear policy that focuses on designing practical programmes that can enhance the living standards of poor people should be designed and reinforced in all zakat institutions. Research limitation/Implications: The study’s data is limited from 2007 to 2015. This is due to the inconsistency and missing data related to the distribution of zakat. Nevertheless, this study extends the existing zakat management literature, especially in the context of zakat collection and distribution among beneficiaries. Furthermore, the present study highlights important issues on how to manage zakat funds in Malaysia practically. © 2023, Faculty of Business and Economics,University of Malaya. All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: A binary logistic regression model was used to analyze poverty reduction and income, education, household size, age and saving of IMFS through a semi-closed questionnaire by using a purposive sampling technique. A semi-closed interview with higher officials from an Islamic microfinance service was also used. Findings: The study results show that the income, education, household size and age of the IMFS’ clients are the major influencing factors that affect poverty reduction in Ethiopia. Practical implications: The study’s findings provide insights for policymakers to revise intensively their regulations and directives for Islamic microfinance operators. It emphasizes the government’s role in serving the community’s interests through financial inclusion and in developing programs to enhance the effectiveness of Islamic microfinance operations in the poverty reduction process. As a social implication, Islamic microfinance service providers gain insights into how beneficiary-side variables contribute to the country’s poverty reduction after offering Islamic microfinance products to them. Originality/value: The results of this study are distinctive because they show how poverty reduction in Ethiopia is influenced by how income level is increased, how better educational level is attained, how household size is managed and how well the age of the client is effectively used for productivity.

Prosperity in Indonesia is still not evenly distributed, it can only be enjoyed by some of the Indonesian population. Muslims constitute the majority of Indonesia's population, including those who have not experienced prosperity. Identification of economic problems as the cause of not achieving the welfare goals of Muslims, among others, caused by poverty, unequal income and poverty. Responding to these problems, there is a need for an economic strategy to realize people's welfare. This study uses a normative legal method using a community empowerment theory approach. Research data is based on literature studies which refer to journal articles, books and scientific sources related to the focus of discussion. This research concludes that in the context of zakat management, there are several strategies that need to be carried out in the context of community empowerment, including optimizing the management of sharia social funds sourced from alms (zakat), donations (infaq), alms (sadakah), and waqf (ziswaf) as well as welfare empowerment.

The purpose of this research is to develop a zakat-recording application that is automatically and continuously synchronized across all user interfaces. Therefore, it can aid in ensuring that the worthiest or Mustahik are properly receiving zakat from the Muzakki (zakat payers) and that all transactions are legitimate. The research procedure used was the development of the Extreme Programming (XP) approach. The number of research subjects involved was 255 people, consisting of zakat ambassadors, group managers, area managers, local committees (called Panzisda), regional committees (called Panziswil), and institutional committees. With the assistance of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ), an evaluation of the newly developed system was performed. The findings of the evaluation of the system development demonstrate that users have provided satisfactory evaluations on several characteristics, including attractiveness (1.72), accuracy (1.75), efficiency (1.55), dependence (1.50), stimulation (1.72), and novelty (1.03).

	abstract = {Several previous studies state that the Islamic Social Finance program has not fully succeeded in creating prosperity, and there are no definite measurements to show the sustainability impact of the program. Thus, a measurement is needed to analyze various aspects in achieving the success and sustainability of Islamic social finance programs. This study developed an index for performance evaluation with an emphasis on the success and sustainability of the Islamic Social Finance program. The study used the Analytical Network Process to determine and analyze priority components. Furthermore, the Multistage Weighted Index method was used to calculate the final index score. The index was built by taking into consideration various factors, stakeholders, aspects, and indicators. This study indicates that aspects of funding contribution from donors (0.22), involvement of donors in giving advice (0.99), and controlling of supervisor (0.08) are priority aspects in the success and sustainability of the program. An empirical investigation was performed on three different programs in Indonesia: A, B, and C. Program A (0.81) and C (0.80) have succeeded in improving the beneficiaries' quality of life to the level of economic resilience, although at a low level of sustainability (76-84.33). On the other hand, program B (0.73) is at the economic reinforcement and has not yet achieved sustainability. This index can be seen as a comprehensive tool for measuring the success and sustainability of the program at several levels. © 2022 Widiastuti et al.

Findings: The findings show that insured vulnerable people and income-generating activities have a significant positive relationship. The results, on the other hand, show a marginally negative effect on income for those who have directly paid poor people.

This model presumably, can ensure sustainable economic livelihoods for the poor entrepreneurs by enhancing their income through higher entrepreneurial exercises while providing them with the ownership of tangible assets. To assess the viability of this model, we conducted a study adopting the qualitative method. We took in-depth interviews of three experts in Islamic finance and banking by using an open-ended questionnaire articulated with the vital issues of MM&M financing. According to experts’ opinions, relevant skills, religiosity, and product knowledge can be considered clients’ primary attributes for letting them access these financing schemes. Nevertheless, the involvement of third-party guarantors, cash waqf, and technology usage will augment the usefulness of this financing approach. Outcomes of this study will help incorporate MM&M within the context of Islamic microfinance while opening windows for further research. © 2022, Statistical Economic and Social Research and.

This article aims to describe the utilization of zakat in East Java province and analyze it using the principles of Maqashid Sharia. This article is based on empirical research using a conceptual approach. Primary data was generated from interviews with Badan Amil Zakat East Java, Yayasan Dana Sosial Al-Falah Malang, Nurul Hayat Malang, and Baitul Mal Hidayatullah Malang. This study shows that zakat management institutions have distributed productive zakat. There are three models of the productive distribution of zakat: the provision of Business Capital, Revolving Funds, and scholarships. Productive management of zakat can be maximized through mentoring and monitoring the program. Assistance to mustahiq beneficiaries can improve the quality of religious knowledge, reason, and economic income as stated in maqashid syariah. © 2022 Ramadhita, et., all.},

	abstract = {The economic development of villages has a substantial impact on community welfare. It can become the backbone of the national economy. However, significant obstacles in village development are lack of human resources (HR), high poverty rates, poor common welfare, justice, and prosperity values. In 2022, in Indonesia there are 9584 underdeveloped villages. Some of the causes of the weak economic condition of a village are economic potential was not optimized, and excessive government interference stifled creativity and independence. This study seeks to explore the extent of the positive impact of the sharia economic implementation model in developing the village's economy and the model's potential as an alternative solution to building the economy of poor villages. This paper used descriptive qualitative methods, observations, and interviews with community leaders, community representatives, and the regency office. The results show that the economic development strategies carried out by Gerdu Village had three stages, namely (1) education and cooperation, (2) implementation and management, and (3) evaluation and planning. In addition, the internal driving factor behind the success of the village's development lies in the activeness of village leaders in implementing sharia economics. As for cooperation with external parties, National Zakat Institution, related local department government, and other institutions around the village have also actively assisted in its development. Positive impacts on the community include increased employment opportunities, income, tourist visits, and tourism and language village programs. This study is expected to be one of the references to explain the Islamic economy's role in advancing the poor village's economy.  © Azhar Alam, Ririn Tri Ratnasari, Boby Habibi, Fauzul Hanif Noor Athief, 2022.},

	abstract = {Over the years, waqf institutions have played an essential role in addressing a wide range of socio-economic development for the ummah (society) all over the world. The growth of waqf with time has led to increasing expectations surrounding the role of waqf institutions. Nevertheless, there has been an inefficiency issue regarding waqf institutions in Malaysia. The literature emphasises that inefficiency is usually associated with internal factors such as governance and management. Hence, the present study examines whether governance moderates the relationship between human capital in Waqf institution and waqf regulations (both as a proxy of waqf management attribute) with waqf institutions’ performance in Malaysia. The current research employed a quantitative research methodology by analysing a selected sample of 99 respondents in waqf institutions. The developed model was tested using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) technique through the Partial Least Square (PLS) approach. The results revealed a positive relationship between waqf management attribute and waqf performance, which becomes stronger with high governance. Moreover, it should be noted that the use of governance as a moderator between waqf management attribute and waqf performance is very limited in past research. Therefore, the present study’s result is expected to enhance the understanding of existing conceptual literature on the importance of governance in influencing the relationship between waqf management attributes and waqf institutions’ performance in Malaysia. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The growth of waqf in Malaysia and Indonesia has become ever more significant. The recognition of the importance of waqf to Malaysia and Indonesia’s economy is demonstrated by the utter value and breadth for entrepreneurs of the support structures and policies. The primary purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that influence the awareness of waqf entrepreneurship in Malaysia and Indonesia. Questionnaires were distributed to the 188 respondents, and the sampling procedure adopted in this research was purposive sampling. The result indicates that knowledge, promotion, and attitude become the essential factors influencing awareness towards waqf entrepreneurship. Besides, knowledge is identified as the best predictor to influence awareness. The findings contribute to the literature by identifying the determinants to impact awareness, particularly on waqf entrepreneurship. This is important because entrepreneurship can promote social change to innovation, therefore improving society's life. It will be very beneficial if the number of entrepreneurs can be increased without relying on the government budget to help the communities, particularly for countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. © 2022, International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {This paper studies the concept of waqf in its historical evolution in order to understand its role as a substitute for government in providing social services to the most vulnerable parts of the population in Islamic history since the 7th century. In the literature, there are mainly two schools that explain why awqaf flourished during the medieval period with some ups and downs until the end of Ottoman rule with the fall and near disappearance of awqaf in the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The first school, among which orientalists constitute the majority, consider awqaf as the main culprit for the failure of the industrialization and modernization of Muslim economies to achieve the aspired economic growth. According to them, awqaf were mainly used as an instrument to shelter wealth, circumvent inheritance laws, avoid taxes, and state confiscations. On the other hand, researchers of the other school blame colonial and post-colonial influence for destruction and/or disappearance awqaf by centralizing existing awqaf under state control or confiscating awqaf. This study lays the groundwork for an alternative view explaining the harmful role of the state in the success or failure of awqaf. The independence of judicial systems, or lack thereof, has played a major role in defining the performance of awqaf in the Middle East © 2023, Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics.All Rights Reserved.},

Furthermore, variables like as education level and poverty rates contribute to the community's poor health conditions, which frequently leads to them turning to high-interest loans supplied by moneylenders. Advocates of productive zakat, who give capital support to citizens, freeing them from the clutches of excessive loan rates, have proposed a solution to this dilemma. This study intends to provide information that can help zakat administrators (such as BAZ and LAZ) develop priority initiatives aimed at improving healthy lives and self-sufficiency patterns. When directed as assistance for the community's health-promoting activities, productive zakat has the potential to improve well-being.This study intends to provide an examination of how productive zakat promotes healthy lives and, as a result, well-being. It also investigates the influence of productive zakat on encouraging self-reliance patterns and the resulting implications on the welfare of people in need, using blockchain technology. It takes a mixed-methodologies approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods within a sequential explanatory frame-work.The quantitative data analysis employs SEMPLS via the smartPLS program, and the qualitative data analysis employs phenomenological analysis using the ATLAS.ti software. In terms of building self-sufficiency, the provision of skills and capital through productive zakat has an impact on autonomous patterns. However, it is vital to emphasize that productive zakat has no direct influence on the design of self-reliance, and self-reliance patterns have no substantial impact on the mustahik's welfare. © 2023 IEEE.},

We do so by developing the agent-based model and scenario-based computer simulations for financing solar powerplants. For this purpose, we redesign a waqf-based financing system and analyze the changes in wealth inequality, capital pooling, and social prosperity for a future time frame. As a proof-of-concept, the simulation results show that for the given case study, the proposed WOFI reduces wealth inequality dramatically, whereas conventional debt-based financing models raise inequality. Besides, restructuring the waqf-based financial intermediaries also enables the capital pooling essential for large projects and absent in the conventional waqf system. In short, this study proves that waqf-based institutions have a remarkable potential to contribute towards sustainable development goals by taking account of long-run social implications, economic growth, and environment-friendly projects. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine the digital-based zakat management information system and strategies for increasing ZIS fund income from the perspective of muamalah fiqh in NTB and Aceh. This study focuses on using SimBaznas on the loyalty of zakat payments, the cand constraints, and strategies taken to increase zakat payments in the two regions. This is a mixed-method study to obtain more comprehensive, reliable, and objective data. The results showed that the implementation of SimBaznas at Baznas in NTB was only carried out on reporting zakat collection that had been carried out properly, while reports and asset reports had not been well informed in SimBaznas. Meanwhile, in Aceh Province, all SimBaznas features have not been effective. Quantitative analysis shows that the ease of use and availability of facilities and infrastructure do not guarantee a correlation with the implementation of SimBaznas in the two provinces. In addition, the seriousness of the interest of SimBaznas users has an effective effect on the implementation of the system. However, it is certain that the existence of SimBaznas has no significant effect on the loyalty of Muslims in the two provinces. The problem with using SimBaznas is caused by the lack of quantity and quality of IT-based human resources. Therefore, the strategies that can be applied are improving the quality and quantity of SimBaznas IT managers, socializing SimBaznas to the public, encouraging ratifying the law on zakat as a tax deduction, and finalizing the regulation of zakat as PAD in Aceh. Therefore, in the context of fiqh muamalah, Baitul Mal will increasingly contribute to poverty alleviation, economic development, and human resource development in NTB, Aceh, and Indonesia. © 2022 Samarah.

ISF institutions enjoy sufficient financial capacity to bridge the gaps and realize the most relevant and urgent SDGs. However, due to policies and other constraints, their participation in international development aid programs is limited. Accordingly, this study explores the existing policy divide between Western and Islamic countries regarding the use of Faith-Based funds in international humanitarian and development aid programs. Through case studies, this study demonstrates that ISF instruments have the potential at national and international levels to mobilize resources to support marginalized groups in society in various countries. The analysis indicates the need to develop a framework that helps to build cooperation among local and international actors to mobilize ISF funds for cross-country development and humanitarian aid, which accelerates the achievement of the SDGs. This paper studies ongoing dialogues among various stakeholders to create policy convergence and to use ISF instruments towards SDGs. This study suggests that the dialogue should be more inclusive by including all potential stakeholders, including Muslim leaders, policymakers and Shariah Scholars, to narrow policy gaps and to draw policy coherence for using ISF tools in the duality aid programs and for creating synergies towards achieving the SDGs. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST) method, with three groups of knowledgeable respondents, including expert, BMT practitioner and regulator to formulate important and certain policies. Findings: The results show that four types of policies are required to improve cash waqf system of BMT, including 12 internal strategic policies, 15 internal operational policies, 15 external strategic policies and 9 external operational policies, which were found to be within a “certain planning region.” All of these policies have been agreed significantly by each group of respondents, as well as by all respondents combined. The most important-certain policies include Shiddiq, Amanah and professional Nazir, inculcate Islamic values to BMT employees and members, standard operating procedure and standard operating management of cash waqf management, technical assistance for Nazir to manage cash waqf and IT systems for BMT-cash waqf administration. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative method used has its limitations, which could be improved by incorporating other methods. Moreover, the case and respondents are all Indonesian, so that the results are possibly only applicable to BMTs in Indonesia. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt these policies in implementing their cash waqf management optimally. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help improve the social activities of the Baitul Maal directly from social cash waqf and indirectly from productive cash waqf. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study using SAST method to determine policies needed by the BMT to upgrade its cash waqf management producing more social programs for the society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The microfinance model caters to the financial and social intermediation needs through a set of financial services and non-financial support. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses both a mathematical model and an empirical estimation using micro panel data to establish the core problem in microfinance operations. Conclusions from the mathematical model and estimated results in the empirical analysis are used to suggest an institutional design which embeds technology in the delivery of Islamic microfinance in an integrated structure. For screening and incentive conditions, the study gives illustration through numerical examples. Findings: The mathematical model highlights the need for financial sustainability, outreach, scale and complementariness of non-financial factors such as commitment, repayment incentives and skills enhancement multiplier. In light of this, the proposed Islamic microfinance model is outlined to create synergies by integrating a diversity of funding sources through social savings and impact investments. The programme also blends financial services with non-financial support to ensure engagement and commitment on a long-term basis. It uses Fintech in various demand and supply-side operations to show how technology embeddedness can help in achieving cost efficiencies and extend outreach. Originality/value: It is the first study in integrated institutional design in Islamic microfinance literature that embeds Fintech in both demand side and supply side operations comprehensively. The proposed model is conducive for enhancing outreach, scale and impact in the Islamic microfinancial services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study population comprised the Baitut Tamwil Muhammadiyah (BTM) in Central Java Province, Indonesia. The data collection techniques included questionnaires and an in-depth interview, and the framework was validated by the main participants. Findings: This study showed that BTMs have implemented risk management using different standards. However, such risk management is carried out partially while prioritising certain risks and using different methods. The risk of Sharia compliance is the most recognised risk, while financing and operational risks are the most anticipated, because these two risk types directly impact financial performance and sustainability. In general, a risk management model can improve financial performance and sustainability. Nevertheless, there are obstacles in implementing risk management at BTMs, which include weak human resources, the employee selection process, human resource development and a good control system.

	abstract = {This paper provides a sustainable Islamic microfinance design using an appreciative intelligence approach to enhance the poor borrowers' accessibility to micro financing in Indonesia. This study aims to identify problems faced by BMT in Indonesia and find the solution to implement sustainable Islamic microfinance. It uses a qualitative analysis by adopting an appreciative intelligence approach. Data was collected by interviewing the Chairman and officer of Central BMT (Induk Koperasi Syariah), Jakarta in 382 BMT's throughout Indonesia. The steps: (i) reframing problems into possibilities, (ii) appreciating the positive meaning and promise of every being, experience, situation, and (iii) linking the generative strength of the present with the preferred vision. The results show that BMT faced four problems in implementing sustainable Islamic microfinance, namely lending limit regulation, high funding pricing to the borrowers, APEX BMT realization, and productive use funding. Several solutions have been suggested by using the appreciative intelligence approach. This paper adds to the literature on Islamic microfinance by enabling researchers and practitioners to apply the appreciative intelligence model of sustainable Islamic microfinance. It also contributes towards enriching the knowledge in the Islamic microfinance and sustainable Islamic microfinance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The population of this research are 573 beneficiaries of zakat and 236 samples (Slovin formula). Respondents are members of the BAZNAS (Badan Amil Zakat Nasional) business group in West Java Province. The results show that all Zakat Community Development’s (ZCD) have sufficient sustainability values from an economic perspective. The Squared Correlation (RSQ) value is 91.85 percent, and therefore, it suggests that the results of the Multidimensional Scaling analysis on the Zakat Community Development from an economic perspective can be explained as very good. The factor of income level becomes a decisive factor that is the most influential in the increase of economic sustainability. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The large potential of zakat funds can support the government's efforts in alleviating poverty. However, its management has not been seen optimally even though BAZNAS has been designated as the official agency and the only non-structural government agency that manages zakat. This study aims to investigate the important role of the human generation who are members of the Muslim community in collecting zakat at the BAZNAS in the era of digital society 5.0 to realize the SDGs. This study uses a literature study method with library data collection techniques, reading and taking notes, and managing research materials by tracing written sources that have been previously written. This study uses content analysis techniques to obtain written information that focuses on four dimensions, namely human generation, Muslim community, zakat collection, and sustainable development goals. The findings reveal that two generations of humans are members of the Muslim community that have the potential to increase zakat collection. Deeper, Maqāṣid shari'āh as the essence of Islamic law through the values of justice, freedom, and human rights of the Muslim community will support the goal of collecting zakat. The novelty of this research found that building the strength and glory of BAZNAS in the era of digital society 5.0 requires strong social ties from the entire Muslim generation community, especially the younger generation community. The main contribution of this research highlights the ‘zakat movement' led by BAZNAS to pay more attention to the role of the millennial Muslim generation community and iGeneration in supporting zakat empowerment programs to realize Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023, Institut Agama Islam Negeri Batusangkar.

	abstract = {Historical evidence demonstrates the enormous role waqf institutions have played in the development and advancement of Muslims throughout the Muslim history. With the proper structure and strategy, waqf contributes to numerous spheres of life, including mainstream economic development. Contemporary development of Islamic finance has enabled the waqf concept to be linked to various financial products, including Shariah-compliant investment instruments, such as, Islamic unit trust funds and Islamic wholesale funds. This paper aims to highlight the current applications of the Waqf-Featured Fund (WFF) in the Malaysia Islamic Fund Management Industry. This is in relation to the launch of a new WFF framework to facilitate the offering of Islamic funds with waqf characteristics. The study took both qualitative via in-depth semi-structured interviews with eleven (11) WFF stakeholders, as well as, analyzing of policy documents, journal articles, books, and online resources. The findings shed light on the current issues and challenges confronting waqf projects in Malaysia, as well as the current guidelines and essential requirements for the WFF, the current application of the WFF in the Malaysian Islamic Fund Management (IFM) industry, and a proposal for the future application model, which includes fund collection, investment structure, distribution process, and fund reporting. © (2023), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah).

This paper presents a comprehensive literature review focusing on assessing the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs) through various model measurements from a global perspective published in reputable international journals until 2023. The authors have applied several literature review techniques, including bibliometric citation and content analysis, to review past studies. The collected manuscripts comprise 52 papers published from 2008 to 2023, categorized into various research topics. The results indicate that research on sustainability performance in the Islamic finance sector is still scarce, despite experiencing a fairly fluctuating increase. The highest number of publications was in the year 2023, with a total of 11 papers (19%) out of the overall publications. The findings from our research show that existing studies have used a variety of techniques to measure the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs). The review highlights that the most frequently utilized models in measuring the sustainability of Islamic microfinance institutions use qualitative approaches. However, 37% of articles within the collection employ quantitative measurements. Previous research generally considers financial and social aspects or spiritual dimensions as separate elements.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study used the Centre of Islamic Economic and Business Studies (CIBEST) model as a poverty measure and the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index as income inequality measures to analyse 1,300 zakat recipients in five different areas of West Java, Indonesia. Findings: Based on the CIBEST model, zakat distribution programmes have better salutary effects on male-headed households in terms of material (0.215) and absolute (0.037) poverty indices, whereas female-headed households have better performance on the falah (0.438) and spiritual (0.022) poverty indices, with greater changes in these indices in female-headed households. According to the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index, female-headed households have better income distribution one-year after zakat distribution programmes, whereas the male-headed households have better performance in regards to welfare loss. Research limitations/implications: The present study only used the poverty line standard published by the Central Board of Statistics from the Republic of Indonesia to identify respondents who live under the poverty line. Practical implications: This paper can serve as a reference for zakat institutions in the implementation of zakat distribution programmes when the gender of zakat recipients is taken into consideration. Originality/value: Not many studies have analysed the impact of gender in zakat distribution programmes despite gender being one of the most important determinants of poverty and income inequality. This study attempts to determine the economic impact of zakat from the perspective of gender. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Indonesia as a country with the largest Muslim population in the world has a very large potential for state revenue from zakat instruments. Zakat as a financial distribution can be used to reduce poverty and improve the welfare of the people, whereby the property can be distributed to eligible individuals. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to distribute zakat that is fair and in accordance with the needs of mustahik. The existence of determining indicators to assess the level of welfare of mustahik is needed for the proper distribution of zakat. Decision support system for selection of zakat mustahik is used by amil zakat institution as decision makers to assist in decision making. Based on flexibility and eficiency, the Analytical Network Process (ANP) method is more reliable than Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and other multi criteria decision making methods. ANP is superior to AHP in simplicity, connectivity, more objective comparisons, more accurate predictions, more stable results and robust. Therefore, in this study we use ANP method to determine the best mustahik priority scale with health and wealth criteria. The sub-criteria for health are family head's health condition, condition of pregnant women, serious illness, and medical ability. While the sub-criteria of wealth are income, job, age, the number of dependents, number of children attending school, item ownership, and home condition. The stages of this research are problem identification, data collection, design of priority determination methods, decision support system using ANP, and implementation. Based on the results we obtained that the order of priority of the mustahik which is A1, A2 and A3. This value data is taken directly from the supermatrix boundary which is the highest normal value of 0,48496 achieved by A1 as the best mustahik. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Single motherhood has been well documented to have adverse impacts on financial wellbeing and they are prone to fall into poverty trap. In Malaysia, the term single mother generally refers to widowed and divorced mothers. Income earned from employment is one of the main sources of livelihood for single mothers, which is sometimes supplemented by child support and other transfers such as pension, welfare assistance, tithe (zakat) and hands out. The types of employment held by low income single mothers are rather limited due to their level of educational attainment, locality, mobility and childcare responsibility. These barriers seem to restrict their work choices and they have to find ways around it, usually by entering informal employment or self-employment sectors. This study discusses employment characteristics of single mothers from the lowest quantile of the society. It is important to explore this issue as these mothers are likely raising their children in constant hardship. This study employs a qualitative quest to gain a deeper understanding of this issue. The respondents of this study come from different states in Peninsular Malaysia. Upon completion of this study, we could suggest that precarious employment of single mothers posed a real threat for the wellbeing of their family. Those involved in informal sectors are the most vulnerable. Without a proper employment contract as in formal sectors, they have no work benefits or protection against unforeseen circumstances. Insufficient and irregular income worry them endlessly as the survival of their family is at stake. Moreover, worries about financial situations could also lead to other health concerns. The findings of this study emphasize the urgency of government intervention that is well planned and targeted. The society at large should also be more sensitive and empathetic towards single mothers and their children. Indeed, children living in poverty should not be tolerated at all. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {The role of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in economic development has been duly recognised. However, SMEs encounter a number of challenges. The most pressing obstacle SMEs face is the lack of finance. Therefore, it is extremely important to find new and suitable finance sources in order to support SMEs either in their establishment or growth phases. Waqf is regarded one of the best sources of finance in the Islamic financial system. There is much potential in its use to finance SMEs financing. The present study explored the prospect of Waqf as an Islamic financial instrument to finance SMEs. It further examined a proposed modified Waqf model and whether it was applicable in Yemen. The study has adopted a qualitative method in the form of semi-structured interviews with 6 experts from Waqf institutions and from SMEs developmental institutions. The experts interviewed are mainly SMEs owners, Waqf directors and beneficiaries specialized in the areas of Waqf and SMEs. The findings of the study indicate that Waqf appeared to be one of the most important instruments in financing such economic activities as it can play a crucial role in financing SMEs. Further, the study significantly contributed by suggesting a new method that will help in financing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Yemen. Thus, providing a finance for these firms will help to create more jobs for the low income, which in turn helps in the economic development. © 2022 STAIN Kudus. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Research strengthens a discipline, and it has an enormous impact, locally and globally. Moreover, it provides solutions to human problems for the wellbeing of all. The rapid growth of scientific research in Islamic economics and the in-crease in the poverty rate among Muslim communities necessitated the urgent need to assess the trends in its knowledge construction and make future research in line with its aims to address current problems. On this reflection, bibliometric research was conducted on four influential Islamic economics journals in the Scopus data-base from 2010 to 2019. The study identified the productivity of the discipline and examined the most frequently covered topics, most cited articles and most contrib-uting authors, institutions and countries. The aims are to examine and evaluate the trends in Islamic economics research, analyze the contents and topics in relation to the primary objectives of the discipline, and recommend future research trends based on current realities and objectives. The initial database search reveals 638 documents from the four journals, of which 612 are article have met the research criteria. The results of the bibliometric analysis reveal that the research focuses mainly on Islamic banking and finance as compared to Islamic social finance, with corporate social reporting of Islamic financial institutions receiving the attention of researchers, while social finance such as Zakāh and Waqf, which has a direct im-pact on the wellbeing of the poor, has been neglected. This could therefore be a gap in research aimed at achieving the discipline's primary objective of ensuring wel-fare and not at encouraging a new version of capitalist ideology that pays too much attention to profit maximization ideology. © 2022,International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.

The data set covers 326 conventional MFIs and 57 Islamic MFIs in six different regions over the period of 2005–2015. Findings: Overconfidence proxies have shown through high loan growth, low-interest margin and loan loss provision reveal negative consequences on risk-exposures for both MFIs averagely. The loan officer’s overconfidence is significantly and positively related to the risk-taking decision, and thus, a lower loan portfolio quality.

	abstract = {In this research, we present a framework for blended Islamic finance for impactful small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The blend results from discussing the pertinent perspectives that underlie the motives of philanthropy, private sector activities and public sector facilitation. The consensus of these three stakeholders on the impact criteria is an essential precondition for the blend to happen. Therefore, we first developed the consensus-based impact criteria for SMEs, namely, 4Zeros & SS (zero-waste, zero-emissions, zero-interest, zero-foreclosures and service to society). After that, we adopted a financial engineering approach to design products by blending the three motives. Financial contracts could be incentive compatible and effective if these three motivations are recognized and brought together. The purpose of our research is to offer such incentive-compatible structures that can mobilize funding for impactful SMEs, save cost as well as generate revenue for self-sustainability. In the contract design, the private sector provides finance, the philanthropist pays the costs of funds, the public sector facilitates, and the impactful SME gets subsidized financing. Since the blended nature of the contract provides a social subsidy to fund the cost element of the financing, the proposed structure creates a win-win result for the blending parties. While financial institutions expand into the SMEs sector for profitability, blended Islamic finance will attract additional resources toward enhancing development impact. Through the philanthropic component, SMEs, on the other hand, will access the source of social subsidy that will relieve the burden of the exorbitant commercial rates. The funding structure will reduce risk perception and spur growth. Consequently, this collaborative and innovative contract design will contribute to achieving multidimensional human development, as enshrined in the Maqasid al-Shariah, and the SDGs. Impactful businesses must integrate environmental, social and governance best practices as well as national development goals. Hence, the proposal offers several benefits and prospects of extended use for other consensus-based purposes such as low-cost housing, solar panelling, health, education, etc.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

It uses a qualitative approach through observation, documentation and interviews with officials and those in charge of waqf from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. The data was then elaborated with expert opinions based on Herman Daly’s sustainable economic theory and John Locke’s theory of ownership and Islamic law theory (hifz al-mãl, himãyah al-bī‘ah and istiṣlãh). This study found that through the waqf system, the waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia managed to reach certain achievements, namely good education, poverty reduction, hunger alleviation, and decent work. It was found that waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out various programs in every area of sustainable development, including providing drinking water. Another service included digging wells in areas where they were needed, which we rarely found in Indonesia. The Sustainable Waqf Law contributed to several aspects that could positively impact society and sustainable development in general. The Sustainable Waqf Law could positively impact sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. In addition, the waqf contributed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13 and 16. Finally, it is important to involve various parties, including waqf institutions, government, communities, and other stakeholders, to ensure the sustainability, transparency, and fairness in the management of waqf assets and their utilization in achieving sustainable development goals. © (), ().

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel Shariah-compliant portfolio optimization model tested on the daily historical return of 154 Shariah-compliant securities reported by the Shariah Advisory Council of Securities Commission Malaysia from 2011 to 2020. The mathematical model employs an annual rebalancing strategy subject to a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint while considering practical and Islamic trading concerns, including transaction costs, holding limits, and zakat payment. To validate the model, the optimal portfolios are compared against an Islamic benchmark index, a market index, and portfolios generated by the mean-variance model, as well as a forecast accuracy test by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error. Furthermore, this study examines the inter-stock relationship within the generated portfolios using correlation and Granger causality tests to identify the diversification performance. Results show an outperformance of the model in offering portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns under a comparably short computational time and an indication of generally well-diversified portfolios by the weak correlations between securities. The study further noted that the model is adept at risk management in addition to higher forecast accuracy during financial crises by showing remarkably fewer causal relationships during bear markets in 2011, 2014, and 2020. The findings of an inversed relationship between portfolio risk and the number of causalities between securities offer new insights into the effect of dynamic relationships between securities on portfolio diversification. In conclusion, the proposed model carries higher moral and social values than the conventional models while portraying high potential in enhancing the efficiency of asset allocation, contributing to economic diversification and the scarce literature on Islamic portfolio optimization modelling. The study also supports the substantially increasing demand for Shariah-compliant strategies following globalization and the changing demographic of the real financial world with growing priorities of social and sustainability values. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

The word Takaful, although used to refer to Islamic insurance, means solidarity and is used as such in this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used a descriptive and analytical method to present findings derived from secondary data collected from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and primary data from semi-structured interviews. Findings: Need in the Palestinian household is very high, and the performance of Palestinian MF institutions (MFI) was found to have deviated from the spirit of MF. A significant shortcoming by MFI lies in the Palestinian law that focuses on organizing MFI’s operations as financial institutions only. With a deviated purpose and generalized laws, the paper proposed a model of IMF. The model consists of three stages covering mission and market-based financing for the economically incapable and those better off. Finally, enacting laws to protect micro-enterprises and cooperation between institutions that operate at each stage is necessary. Originality/value: This research contributes to the literature on MF and IsMF, especially in high-risk countries. Furthermore, this study proposes a model for IsMF best practices based on the spirit of MF where it is most needed. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To address this gap, this study expands the aforementioned theories through the integration of customer financial condition through the analyzes of both direct and indirect effects. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative research design was deployed through data, which was collected from samples of microentrepreneurs within the agricultural sector of northwestern Nigeria. The data from this sample was analyzed through hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: The findings confirmed significant direct effects of all the original TPB variables; attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on acceptance intention of Islamic microfinance. More pioneering, the study established a significant direct negative effect of customer financial condition on the acceptance of Islamic microfinance among agribusiness customers. It further established the indirect (moderating) effects of customer financial condition on the influence of subject norms and perceived behavioral control on acceptance intention of Islamic microfinance, however, such indirect effect was not established in relation to the influence of attitude. Research limitations/implications: The findings implied that the providers of Islamic financial products and services should target Nigeria’s frontier market as a potential avenue for expanding their existing market share. More specifically, the agricultural sector of northwestern Nigeria could be given focus in such a marketing strategy. In terms of social impact, providing necessary finances to the agricultural sector will further enhance employment creation and reduce poverty in the northwestern region. Originality/value: Despite several extensions of TRA and TPB in various settings, this could the first study which examined both direct and indirect effects of customer financial condition not only in relation to the acceptance of Islamic microfinance but also all other Islamic financial products and services. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously damaged the socio-economic development of Nigerians. Meanwhile, the country is in a debt crisis, which is largely attributed to the fall in the price of crude oil revenue that is used to finance its budget. This makes it difficult to provide sustainable support towards poverty alleviation in the country during the pandemic. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore various technological applications to apply in the revitalization of Islamic social finance instruments in Nigeria. Through a review of literature, the study provides various fintech applications that are essential for reviving the role of Islamic social finance instruments, particularly zakat and waqf institutions for sustainable poverty alleviation in the country. Besides, the benefits of supporting Islamic social finance instruments with technological applications were also provided for the efficient and effective administration, collections and distributions of Islamic social funds. Hence, the study recommends the adaption of the best practices found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bahrain, the U.A.E, etc. Besides, five specific recommendations have been proffered for the successful digitalization of Islamic social finance instruments in Nigeria. These recommendations can feasibly be implemented as it currently has a Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, which is saddled with the responsibility of transforming the country into a fully digital economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Nigeria’s economy is currently the largest in Africa and the world’s 26th, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$600 billion (roughly N81 trillion) in 2017. Unfortunately, the prevalence of poverty in Nigeria is also growing. According to the World Bank estimate, poverty accounts for more than 70% of the population, implying that over 130 million people live below the poverty line. Microfinance is one of the most successful strategies for eliminating poverty since it provides access to financial resources that can assist in reducing poverty by fostering financial involvement and empowerment. Despite the fact that there are over 800 microfinance banks in Nigeria, their contribution to the country’s economy is less than one percent. In addition, the basic objective of eradicating poverty has not yet been attained. Therefore, the extant literature has projected Islamic microfinance banks as a feasible solution to alleviate poverty in Nigeria, especially by looking at many Muslims in the country. Hence, Islamic microfinance banks continue witnessing minimal or no development in Nigeria. This study examines the obstacles impeding the growth of Islamic microfinance banks and their commercial viability. It also aims to provide solutions and recommendations to assist Islamic microfinance banks in regaining the public’s trust by expanding their financial inclusion through various Islamic micro-credit products as a viable alternative to the existing conventional microfinance banks that offer high-interest loans. This study uses qualitative research techniques to fulfil its objectives. The data for this study were gathered using a semi-structured interview. The research reveals several regulatory concerns, such as licence processes and substantial paid-up capital, which is one of the most significant obstacles. Similarly, awareness, misconception, and compliance continue to be the most critical obstacles for IMFBs in Nigeria. Implications of the study for microfinance institutions, policy regulators, and recommendations have been provided in line with the main findings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This article aims to discuss the authority of the state in managing zakat, infaq, and sadaqah (ZIS), and describe the authority of the Baitul Mal in managing ZIS as locally-generated revenue (PAD) in Aceh. The study used a case study approach by using the theory of authority as an analytical tool. Data collection techniques were carried out through interviews and document studies. The informants interviewed were the staff of the Baitul Mal and the staff management of the Ulema Consultative Council (MPU) in Pidie Regency and Sabang City. It found that the state, in this case, Baitul Mal, has the authority to manage ZIS which can be treated as PAD. This practice has contributed to poverty alleviation, scholarships, business capital, and community economic empowerment in Aceh. To facilitate the management of zakat funds, lex specialis can be applied as a position of Islamic law in the national legal framework.

	abstract = {The Niger State of Nigeria is one of the twelve northern states of the federation which adopts Shariah as a legal system during the fourth republic amidst several social challenges. The state emphasizes social reconstructions in its approaches to Shariah implementation and hence, establishes Zakat and Endowment Board for collection and distribution of zakat items to reconcile the society through poverty alleviation. An even distribution of wealth through zakat is hoped to reduce the rate of crime in the region. Northern Nigeria is studied because shariah is practiced only in that region, hence this paper examines the activities of the Board within the time frame of 2001-2017 which was the period of active application of the re-introduced Islamic Criminal Law in the region to identify the level at which the aims of its establishment had been achieved. The historical research method was used in carrying out this study. The authors read previous literature related to the work for background information and further interviewed stakeholders in the government and beneficiaries of the program. The result of the literature and information from the interviewee were analyzed and discussed, and the findings of the work revealed that if Muslim individuals and concerned Muslim organizations did not stand up to strengthen the institution of Zakat in Niger state in particular and in the shariah compliant states in general, the institution will be a shadow of itself. If poverty shall be alleviated through a veritable institution of zakat to reduce the rate of crime in the society, it is recommended that Formidable Islamic organizations in the state such as Jamaatu Nasrullahi-l Fātih Society of Nigeria (NASFAT) and Federation of Muslim Women Organization of Nigeria (FOMWAN) should collectively work on creating an independent zakat board. © The Author(s) (2022).},

	abstract = {Zakāt and Ushr are the important instruments of the Islamic fiscal system. It is an obligatory practice of Islam aiming at helping the society and providing the deprived ones with a better life and opportunities. The fundamentals of the Zakāt and Ushr system have clearly been defined by Shariah. However, its collection and distribution is the responsibility of the state. In this regard, Zakāt and Ushr Ordinance 1980 was enforced in Pakistan. The 18th Constitutional Amendment was notified in the Gazette of Pakistan on April 20, 2010. This amendment has redefined the structural contours of the state through a paradigm shift from a heavily centralized to a predominantly decentralized federation. In this regard the powers of the Ministry of Zakāt and Ushr were devolved from the federal level to the provincial level and thus the powers were given to provinces to make legislations regarding the subject. After this change the provinces made the respective legislations for Zakāt and Ushr. In this article, this provincial legislation is reviewed to find out their harmony with the Income Tax Law and practical steps are suggested to achieve the very purpose of these legislations. These steps will increase the collection of Zakāt and Ushr that would be helpful to alleviate the poverty and overcome the financial problems of our masses predominantly from agricultural areas of Pakistan. This paper aims to discuss the role of Zakāt and Ushr as a mechanism for poverty eradication. For this article, qualitative research methodology is used. The content analysis method is adopted for comparing, quantifying and analyzing the data. Available data on the subject, both in Shariah and conventional law, has been analyzed in detail. © 2021, University of Management and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose and verify the suitability and applicability of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the State of Libya. The proposed models combine the unique features of social solidarity, cooperation “Ta’awan,” meeting religious requirements and providing financing more fairly and equitably. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is applied in this study through semi-structured interviews with several Libyan experts, including Islamic bankers, Shariah scholars, MSMEs experts, Islamic microfinance experts and academicians. The data collected from 2019 to 2021 and thematic analysis by computer-based software NVivo is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicate that the proposed Islamic equity-based microfinance models are suitable and applicable in Libya. This study also reveals that the proposed models have numerous potential benefits not only in meeting the financial needs of MSMEs but also in meeting the government objectives in economic divarication and socioeconomic development. Research limitations/implications: First, the study proposes the applicability and suitability of Islamic equity-based models in financing MSMEs only, while large firms are excluded from the study. Second, the study only proposes and tests the applicability of Islamic equity-modes of financing contracts, namely, Musharakah and Mudarabah, while Islamic debt-based financing models are not included. Finally, as there is no practical evidence of using those models for financing MSMEs in Libya, this study lacks empirical evaluations of equity models’ real benefits on income, employment generation, living standards improvement and business growth and sustainability. Practical implications: Given the importance of the MSMEs sector for the State of Libya’s economic growth, it is expected that the findings of this study can be of assistance in formulating guidelines and implementing Islamic equity-based microfinance programs. Besides, it can be a valuable source of information for policymakers for improving the functions of the current microfinance programs in the country. Additionally, as studies concerning Islamic alternative models for financing MSMEs are scarce, the current study can also be a reference point for researchers, academicians, practitioners and other stakeholders. Social implications: Providing capital support for the underfunded economy segment, attracting small savings, increasing investments and developing entrepreneurial skills could lead to improved economic productivity and growth. Originality/value: The present study proposes the structure of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for MSMEs in Libya and verifies the suitability of those proposed models among Libyan experts. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has been conducted on uncovering and exploring the potentials of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing MSMEs in Libya. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The existence of modern slavery which has re-emerged is an important concern to study because slavery is anti-development. Moreover, Islam seeks to abolish slavery, so that modern slavery should no longer occur in Islamic countries, including Indonesia. This research is conducted using a quantitative descriptive method, with Partial Least Square Method and data from Indonesia in particular since Indonesia is a country with the largest Muslim population in the world. This research is important to be carried out since this subject has never been studied quantitatively. The findings of this study, which are based on the discussion of existing data indicate that quantitatively, in the short term there is no impact on the distribution of Islamic social finance funds, in the form of zakat, infaq, sadaqah on modern slavery of children in Indonesia. Thus, Indonesia, considering that the existence of modern slavery is anti-development as marked by its effect on welfare, as an Islamic country with the largest population in the world should pay more attention to the eradication of modern slavery of children. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The research method used is quantitative. The sampling technique uses a purposive sampling technique. The number of respondents was 156. This study showed that the product knowledge variable had no significant direct effect on the intention of contributing to the endowment of money through salary deductions. Islamic Religiosity is having a substantial impact on the plan to add to the donation of money through salary deductions due to the amount of t-test 2.2303> 1.96. Consumer Attitude significantly affects the intention to contribute to the money endowment through salary deductions because the t-test value is 2.7174> 1.96. Trust greatly influences the aim to add to the donation of money through salary deductions because the t-test value is 3.2647> 1.96. The intention significantly affects the behavior of contributing to Waqf money through salary deductions because of the t-test value of 13.8070> 1.96. Based on the study's results, respondents are willing to make Waqf money through salary cuts. If this can realize, it undoubtedly encourages the acceptance of Waqf money, which in the end, Waqf will further contribute to community economic empowerment (Maukuf Alaih). Related to that, we need a role model first to make further policy steps. © University of Tehran.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a structured questionnaire to acquire the understanding of Malays about the existence of poverty in Malaysia and to identify the demographic groups that can be targeted for the marketing campaigns of cash waqf institutions. The sample consisted of 430 Malays respondents residing in Selangor. The study used the methodology of Baron and Kenny for mediation analysis. Findings: The finding indicates that Malays do hold sympathies towards the poor. Further investigation shows that high-income class and female are the two demographic groups that are more sympathetic towards the poor because of their strong belief in charity. Research limitations/implications: The data collection is limited to Selangor only. However, it provides enough information about the demographic groups which is worth exploring for the future researchers in order to come up with marketing strategies related to cash waqf collections. Practical implications: On the basis of findings, cash waqf institutions in Malaysia can come up with marketing strategies to attract high-income class and females as their potential donors. Originality/value: The charity institution specifically cash waqf institutions in Malaysia are struggling to identify the right target groups for their marketing campaigns. This study used attribution theory to identify the target groups which is overshadowed by the previous research studies in the context of Malaysia. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Many scholars have discussed how Islamic microfinance works to eradicate poverty. However, detailed studies reviewing the literature related to this topic in Indonesia are lacking. Using a systematic method to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature, this study highlights how IMFIs play their role in alleviating poverty in Indonesia. Seven databases of Emerald Management, Science Direct, Google Scholar (English keywords), Google Scholar (Indonesian keywords), ProQuest, Scopus, and Academic Search Complete were used to gather articles published from early January 2016 to the end of 2020. From the data collected, it is found that the number of published articles with the theme “Islamic Microfinance Institutions and poverty alleviation” decreased beginning in 2019, with most of the research consisting of case studies in West Java using qualitative research methods. The impact felt by the community through the implementation of these programmes includes increasing societal welfare and reducing the number of poor micro and small entrepreneurs. This perceived influence has economic, social, and spiritual benefits that can help Indonesia’s economic and social growth. This review is expected to contribute to the evidence supporting poverty alleviation through Islamic microfinance in Indonesia. This becomes important in determining the direction of development and improvement of policies related to the problem. © 2021, Islamic Research Institute. All rights reserved.},

This program is initiated to respond the grave condition of water scarcity as the OIC countries only share 13.3% of the world renewable water due to the desertification, water mismanagement and inadequate water infrastructures. As practical guidelines, the OIC Water Vision employs Islamic values as follow: (1) Shura (consultation and participation); (2) Ijtihad (the seeking and sharing of knowledge); (3) avoiding Fassad (to not causing harm and equitable use), (4) Zakat (sharing of wealth with the poor), and (5) Waqf (the use of donated endowment funds). By using international collaboration as a theoretical framework, this article aims to depict the OIC’s vision of water sustainability; while qualitative method provides a valuable approach to examine both empirical and interpretative data related to the OIC Water Vision programs. We find that Islamic teachings play two aspects in this program, namely in the principal foundation and shared values. © 2022, Statistical Economic and Social Research and. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Technology innovation affects both the public and private non-financial sectors, the zakat institution (Islamic social finance) included. The institution uses an online system to communicate with zakat payers and zakat recipients to ensure its effectiveness in terms of collection and distribution. This research focuses on the adoption of a technique known as AD/AC and ZP/ZR, which is mainly utilized by partially and non-privatized State zakat institutions in Malaysia. To this end, three (3) techniques pertaining to appraising the performance of Malaysia’s Zakat institutions in managing Zakat funds were established. The analysis also includes the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of zakat collection of the respective zakat institutions in Malaysia. In this relation, a quantitative approach was adopted using the primary and secondary data collected from JAWHAR and various states’ zakat institutions. By utilizing a technique of online data collection and applying the AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR methods, the performance of Malaysia’s zakat institutions is appraised. Furthermore, with the help two (2) ratios and eight (8) scenarios the performance of the innovative technique of AD/AC and ZP/ZR for zakat collection and disbursement, efficiency and sustainability of zakat institutions in Malaysia were evaluated. The results show that most zakat institutions, particularly those that deal with zakat payments, have begun to use the technique AD/AC and ZP/ZR within their organizations. The performance of zakat institutions in all states in terms of zakat distribution and disbursement do not have a consistent trend for the period 2016-2020. However, there is still a dearth of technology being used for zakat disbursements and fund reporting. From the observed data, with 2016 being the exception, for each remaining year, a state in Malaysia is ranked as the best technology performer or the most efficient. Selangor - fully privatized state (2017), Pulau Pinang - fully privatized state (2018), Federal Territory - partially privatized state (2019) and Negeri Sembilan-partially privatized state (2020) are the most efficient for the respective year. The sustainability of each zakat institution in Malaysia in the presence of Covid-19 pandemic was ascertained as well. Interestingly, contrary to the efficiency result, all non-privatized states (Kedah, Sabah and Kelantan) and one partially privatized state (Negeri Sembilan) were sustainable in coping with Covid-19 pandemic, while all fully privatized states (Selangor and Pulau Pinang) were not. Overall, it was conjectured that the technique AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR would help to improve the operations of zakat institutions to become more efficient and successful in distributing zakat fund to the poor. However, as zakat collecting and distribution involved millions of records, its management is still debatable by all parties. © Authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: The problem of poverty requires a social innovation-based assistance strategy that involves various parties or collaboration in solving a social problem. Poverty alleviation policies are not only centered on bureaucratic aspects but are also always human-centered (human-centered design) in defining and formulating innovative policies. This research aims to identify stakeholders in social innovation in order to overcome the impacts of poverty. Theoretical framework: This research uses 6 dimensions of social innovation in analyzing the impact of poverty in Indonesia. Apart from that, this research also explains the role of stakeholders through the Quintuple Helix concept where there is a continuous balance between government and society. Method: This research is a type of qualitative research with 50 research informants who refer to five requirements for selecting informants. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with social practitioners so that researchers could get more concrete information about the problems that occurred. Results and conclusions: In the Social Exclusion Dynamics dimension, it was found that the Indonesian Government's policies were able to provide accelerated handling that was not trapped in bureaucratic, techno-technical aspects. By making the community work partners or volunteers who are socially active. The Mobilization of Resources dimension is related to the synergy aspect of multi-stakeholder involvement which is able to provide community capacity development, mastery and understanding of technological information so that it can improve the quality of life. In the Satisfaction of Human Needs dimension, pragmatism in the government system often causes a loss of innovation and creativity in exploring local resources in society. In the context of health service policy, it is often not possible to explore the source of the main problems in society. The dimension of empowerment is the creation of knowledge. Knowledge is data and information combined with ability, intuition, experience, ideas, and motivation from competent sources. In the dimension of Change in Social Relations, social innovation is ultimately able to determine permanent changes in the social environment, power, relations between social groups, government, and society, the state and the private sector. These dynamics are related to those displayed in the triangle of vision, intention, development culture, identity, organizational and institutional dynamics. Meanwhile, in the Territorial Specificity dimension, the research results show that funding for poverty alleviation activities is assisted by CSR programs from industry as well as social assistance from various elements of society, such as institutions, individuals, companies, zakat institutions, foundations, volunteers and others. Research implications: This research has implications for the involvement of stakeholders in social innovation in overcoming the impacts of poverty Originality/value: The value of this research lies in the application of the social innovation dimension through the role of multi-stakeholders in overcoming the impacts of poverty. The research results also provide new value to the role of organic intellectuals which refers to actors who play an important role in society. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the potential of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance (zakat, waqf and Islamic microfinance) to alleviate poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic with the moderating effect of ethical orientation. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through the administration of paper-based and electronic questionnaires to 400 respondents out of which only 277 were found valid for analysis. Findings: The study showed that by direct relationship, the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance instruments have a potentially significant positive contribution to poverty alleviation during the COVID-19 pandemic except for zakat that has an insignificant positive contribution. Ethical oriental has also a significant positive contribution. Contrary to expectation, the moderating effect of ethical orientation has changed zakat and waqf to have significant negative and insignificant positive contributions, respectively. Only Islamic microfinance has endured the moderating effect to continue contributing significantly and positively to the reduction of poverty. Research limitations/implications: The study explored only the potential impact of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance to mitigate the extreme poverty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Practical implications: This study clearly showed the need to create enabling laws and policies to support the operations of zakat and waqf institutions to achieve their objectives effectively and efficiently. These two institutions should be integrated with Islamic microfinance for the possibility of getting better outcomes. Social implications: There should be massive campaigns to restore religious, social and political ethics to enhance the socio-economic development of Nigerians based on the principles of brotherhood. Originality/value: This study provides unexpected and unusual results showing the inability of zakat and waqf institutions to alleviate poverty due to poor ethical orientation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of Qard-al-Hasan (QH) or interest-free loan in reducing multidimensional poverty through examining Fael Khair Waqf (FKW) program as a case. Design/methodology/approach: A Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) approach has been used in this study, which was conducted over 1,600 households including 1,200 program households in 40 villages and 400 control households in 20 villages of 8 districts in the south-western region of Bangladesh. Findings: It is found that 38.5% of sample population was multidimensional poor with deprivation of above the cutoff score. However, FKW participants were relatively less multidimensional poor. It was 35.3%. Hence, it is argued that the FKW is an effective program in terms of poverty reduction as it has contributed to higher economic outcomes for their participating households. The econometric result also suggests that the likelihood of the participants of FKW to be MPI poor is around 1.5 times lower than the nonparticipants, and the result is significant at 1% level. This indicates that program has a positive impact in reducing multidimensional poverty. Practical implications: The analysis in this paper would fill the literature gap by investigating the link between application of QH and poverty alleviation. It will also guide academicians, researchers and decision-makers to design evidence-based policy to alleviate poverty. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no empirical work in Bangladesh on the effectiveness of QH in poverty reduction considering an MPI approach. Hence, this study is a unique contribution to the literature of Islamic social finance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study of an NGO-based IMFI in Malaysia was undertaken, with interviews conducted with officers and managers at various organisational levels of the IMFI. Insights gained from institutional work and institutional logic were used to theorise the findings. Findings: The IMFI used mainly financial measures to manage its performance, which were interlinked with the commercialisation approach in the industry, and the top management’s focus on the financial sustainability of the organisation. The lack of social goals and the use of reward-based financial measures did not weaken the solidified social values at the operational level, due to the independence of the operational units, the compartmentalisation of profit-making activities and the institutional work of the operational managers. The operational managers acted as carriers of this social logic. Religious values formed the pillar of the permanence of social values in the IMFI. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the internal practices of IMFIs, and the role of religious values in the permanence of social logic in the context of an NGO-based IMFI. The lack of measurable social goals, as well as their rewards, does not compromise the focus on poverty alleviation and community development in view of the intrinsic rewards and accountability of the operational managers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: It aims to increase its benefits to realize community welfare and poverty reduction. This research develops a productive Islamic social fund management model for the empowerment of the poor. Theoretical framework: According to Sartika (2008), poverty is a great danger for humanity, and few people fall for their civilization only because of it. Islam, as Ad-In, offers several doctrines for humans that apply universally with two-dimensional characteristics, including happiness and prosperity in the world and hereafter. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an exploratory and qualitative constructive approach. It is to develop models of interaction, integration, and innovation in the management of productive zakat, infaq, and shadaqah funds. Data collection methods include interviews, documentation, and observation. The data was analyzed using the Miles & Huberman (1994) approach, which consists of the collection, reduction, display, and conclusion drawing/verification. Findings: BAZNAS Lumajang Regency, Indonesia, approximately implements the three-circle model of empowering amil zakat institutions. The first circle, which is an increasingly significant fundraising activity, is carried out successfully by BAZNAS Lumajang Regency in Indonesia. This is indicated by the increasing number of Islamic social funds yearly. The second circle, which is an Islamic social fund distribution activity enlarges due to the excellent interaction between BAZNAS management and mustahik / Islamic social fund recipients by direct or indirect means. Research, Practical & Social implications: Studies have focused on productive economic activities to develop a productive Islamic social fund management model. This model explains how BAZNAS or other amil Zakat institutions distribute Islamic social funds from Zakat and infaq to empower the poor and alleviate poverty. All BAZNAS and LAZ Indonesia should use the three-circle model combined with a productive Islamic social fund management model to successfully empowered the poor. Further researchers need to do testing and developing a model of Islamic social fund management model. Originality/value: The studies construct a model of Islamic social fund management consist of integration, interaction and innovation approaches. © 2022 The authors.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research paper aims to determine the factors needed to propose a platform where waqf (Islamic endowment) organizations can collaborate with government public hospitals to develop corporate waqf hospitals. Consequently, the elements of governance and sustainability are included in the management of corporate waqf hospitals thereby leading to the corporatization of public hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the qualitative research methodology and undertakes content analysis of data collected from journal articles, magazines and official websites. Data analysis involves open coding with NVivo 12. Findings: General findings from the literature review have shown that architectural and engineering fundamentals were essential factors in the success of past waqf hospitals of the era between 8th and 14th centuries. In that era, the decentralized waqf-based hospitals employed the mutawalli (the trustee/manager of the waqf assets) to govern the administration of the hospitals. Present corporate waqf hospitals can exploit the elements identified from past waqf-based hospitals and additionally adopt the private-public partnership model in the form of a muḍārabah (profit-sharing contract) agreement to design a sustainable waqf governance model for Malaysian public healthcare services. Research limitations/implications: The proposed platform is designed for a corporate waqf model developed in collaboration between Malaysian waqf institutions and public healthcare services. It abides by both the Malaysian fatwa (Islamic rulings) on waqf and the laws of the Malaysian Government. Practical implications: There is potential for developing the Malaysian corporate waqf-governance healthcare model which will enable the hospital to provide better quality healthcare to more patients through upgrading the quality of equipment used in hospitals and/or better facilities at equal or lower costs. Consequently, this will not only improve waqf management and distribution but also result in reduction of government expenditure. Social implications: This research promotes the concept of a corporate waqf hospital which will provide innumerable beneficial healthcare services in terms of improved healthcare quality at affordable costs to the general public and at no cost to the poor and the underprivileged. Originality/value: Although waqf has played an important role as a vehicle for Islamic financing in the society for centuries, a model of collaboration or partnership of waqf with public healthcare services has yet to be explored and developed. With proper corporate governance and well-managed sustainability in a corporate waqf model, this newly developed partnership between waqf institutions and public healthcare providers can be a first step in many more interesting collaborative arrangements that can be established between waqf institutions and public services in the future. © 2021, Raja Aishah binti Raja Adnan, Mahazan Abdul Mutalib and Muhammad Ridhwan Ab Aziz.},

At the core of all the debates on the development of Islamic economics lies the need for standard texts that would guide the teaching of the new discipline. Islamic economics: Principles and analysis, published forty-two years after the formal ‘birth' of the nascent discipline, represents one of the most important steps in that direction. This paper makes a critical review of the book and offers some insights towards its further improvement. The book has succeeded remarkably in summarizing, evaluating, and simplifying the most important materials on the concept, philosophy, principles, methodology, and frontiers of Islamic economics. It details the analysis of such topics as Islamic microeconomics, macroeconomics, economic development, Islamic finance, Islamic social finance, and the challenges and future directions of Islamic economics. It stands unique given its coverage of essential topics, the caliber of scholars that contributed chapters and made reviews, as well as its rigorous editorial process. Even with areas that need improvement, it is envisaged that the book can spark a new wave of convergence towards consensus on some key concepts in Islamic economics. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

This study uses the Analytic Network Process (ANP). ANP is needed in the problem decomposition framework to structure complexity. There are 16 experts as the respondents. From the results of the ANP, it will also be known what the SDGs criteria, maqashid al-sharia components, and waqf models are priorities in realizing the 5th SDGs. The findings of this study reveal that among the other two, social pillars are the main criteria for the SDGs. In addition, the maqashid al-sharia framework's main objective is preserving religion (deen) as a means of enforcing religious responsibilities. Therefore, stakeholders need to consider this element. Then, according to this study, the best alternative waqf model is Waqf & Zakat, Infaq, Shadaqah (ZIS), which is very suitable for gender equality within the framework of women's empowerment in terms of education, entrepreneurship, and other life skills.

One of the distinctive features of the economic development of the Islamic world is the institution of waqf, which is an integral part of the social history of Muslim society as well as one of its values. This feature is especially true of Central Asia now comprising the five independent republics of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, which used in the past to be flourishing centres of Islamic civilisation, and which are in possession of a rich waqf legacy. The bibliographical survey of waqf literature in Central Asia spans the whole 150-year period which is divided into three phases, namely the Czarist colonial period (1870s-1917), the Soviet period (1920s-1930s till 1992), and the independence period (1992 until the present). Special attention is paid to the historiography of waqf institution in the region, especially pertaining to waqf foundations, and the extensive waqf literature that was generated over the centuries by the institution. The article concludes with a summary of the significance of the study for contemporary waqf studies, particularly in Uzbekistan. © 2023, International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {Zakat in Islam has historically been a vital institution in fulfilling religious needs and social welfare. Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness distribution process and lack of transparency in the zakat management are commonly cited as key impediments (bin Khatiman et al., 2021). Blockchain is expected to solve these issues due to its ability to record and trace every transaction, allowing administrators to discharge their accountability to zakat stakeholders. Thus, this study intended to develop a zakat collection blockchain system with the aim to provide economical and integrated continuous real-time zakat transactions, transparency and traceability by developing smart contracts in zakat management. The study employed four stages of process based on waterfall model starting from the interview session and analyse of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on zakat collection in the Zakat Collection Centre or Pusat Pungutan Zakat-Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). Then, design requirement specification (DRS) is employed after being reviewed and approved by PPZ-MAIWP. The results show that the development of blockchain in the zakat collection system could be eradicating extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity among the community in the country. The study contributes through a transparent and reliable environment for exchanging data and carrying out transactions through a decentralized digital ledger technology to record anything of value and as a result able to ensure transparency, reliability, trust ability and traceability of the zakat transactions. © 2023 The Authors.},

This research qualitatively analyzes how the Micro Waqf Bank has carried out its role in empowering women, including dealing with crises due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used as the qualitative data analysis technique. Informants in this study amounted to 6 informants from MWB Mawaridussalam consisting of Management, Mentors, and female micro-enterprises. The research results quantitatively indicate that there is a positive and significant impact on the joint responsibility system, financing, and mentoring on the development of micro-enterprise members. Mentoring is the most significant variable that impacts the growth of a micro-enterprise business. Qualitatively, the research results show the role of the Micro Waqf Bank in the economic empowerment of women micro-business entrepreneurs by specifically recommending reinforcement of the mentoring function. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: This research aimed to ascertain the people's economic progress throughout the pandemic via the distribution of productive zakat by BAZ/LAZ in Pekalongan. Theoretical Framework: Zakat has evolved as a tool for economic growth and poverty reduction among the peoples of the regions during times of economic distress (Yusroni & Chadhiq, 2021). Zakat provides several benefits over the standard fiscal tools now available. Numerous ideas and theories have been advanced by specialists to address the issue of poverty (Alaro & Alalubosa, 2019; Iqbal & Mirakhor, 2011). However, not all ideas can be implemented and contribute to poverty reduction. It is anticipated that professional zakat administration and profitable usage would enable poverty reduction (Hoque, Khan, & Mohammad, 2015). Design/Methodology/Approach: Field research with a qualitative approach collects, manages, and distributes zakat funds, incredibly productive zakat at BAZ/LAZ in Pekalongan City. The technique is triangulation. Findings: The results showed that BAZ/LAZ in Pekalongan City had implemented effective zakat distribution programs, namely BAZNAS, LAZ Al Ummah, LAZISMU, and LAZ Central Java, while LAZINU had not implemented the effective zakat program optimally. In general, BAZ/LAZ in Pekalongan City used productive zakat to promote the potential of the people via various sorts of productive zakat initiatives throughout the pandemic. The primary objective of productive zakat is similar to that of BAZ/LAZ in Pekalongan City. According to defined protocols, the productive zakat distribution model is carried out precisely and accurately. Research, Practical & Social Implications: Despite several challenges, the distribution of productive zakat continued throughout the COVID-19 epidemic. The effective zakat program emphasizes developing diverse models via creativity and innovation for people's economic growth to avoid poverty. Originality/Value: The findings of the model of economic development of the people run by the mustahik also vary in the efforts carried out whose main objectives are to save, infaq, and develop businesses to avoid the problem of poverty. © 2022 The authors.},

The financial performance is measured by Islamic specific financial performance, including profit sharing financing ratio, zakat performance ratio, equitable distribution ratio, and director employee welfare ratio. The ISR disclosure is measured based on the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic financial (AAOIFI) Governance Standard (GS) 1 and GS 7, consisting of 75 components of exposure in Islamic banks from Indonesia and Malaysia for the 2014-2018 period. This study uses regression analysis. From the analysis of the 90 annual reports, it was found that the level of ISR disclosure in Indonesia and Malaysia had diversity and superiority respectively over the dimensions of ISR disclosure. The content analysis results show that Indonesian Islamic banks have an average total superior exposure of 54% compared to Malaysian state Islamic banks of 47%. Regression tests prove a positive association between profit-sharing financial ratio and zakat performance ratio and the level of ISR disclosure. While the association between the equitable distribution ratio and director employee welfare ratio and the level of ISR disclosure is not proven. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

While a high volume of literary evidence on this Islamic social finance instrument is available, the research motivation and study findings are diverse. Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of waqf literature to understand the pattern and direction of research on Waqf broadly. We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers. © 2021, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.},

This study uses a fixed effect model to analyze the relationship between variables. The findings show that the Islamic human development index, as a proxy for the quality of human resources, supports the reduction of poverty in OIC countries. Furthermore, the zakat, voice and accountability, and trade openness have a negative and significant relationship with poverty. The quality of governance, population, inflation, and exchange rate, on the other hand, has no significant effect on the poverty rate. These findings can be used as the foundation for state government as the policymaker to solve poverty. The uniqueness of this study is the application of the modified human development index based on the five Islamic objectives and empirically investigates its impact on poverty. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The progression of waqf land development in Malaysia is moderate, considering that it is not on the mainstream agenda of the country. Although waqf exists as a religious instrument, it has become an excellent support system for socio-economic development and has contributed to overall public wellness. Anyhow, the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRCs) who become the sole trustee for waqf in the respective states in Malaysia were facing some structural challenges and searching for effective solutions. With the help from literature, this paper has grouped these structural challenges into three, namely as the legislations, administrations, and obligations. Thus, has opened the opportunity for the Special Property Development Entity (SPDE) to offer some solutions to partially resolve the threats of these structural challenges towards waqf land development. The study had interviewed fourteen SIRCs to explore the challenges and solicit the suitability and acceptance of SPDE in the SIRCs. Overall, the SIRCs did not implement the SPDE except for Selangor. However, the SPDE has its potential and can solve some of the structural challenges if the SIRCs implemented this idea. This paper is using the Structure and Agency Model as the basis to understand and resolve the issues at hand. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose Islamic solutions to the Covid-19 health and economic crises, specifically using Islamic social finance (ISF) instruments, including zakat, infaq and waqf. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the qualitative content analysis method, guided by a model of composite approaches of poverty alleviation in Islam, integrated Islamic commercial and social finance (IICSF) and crisis management of Umar bin Khattab, to construct various programs and/or policy actions toward economic recovery in Indonesia. Findings: The results show that ISF with its instruments, especially zakat, infaq and waqf could help the government and the economy to recover from the crisis. The proposed solutions include: save lives, including medical assistance using zakat-infaq and health-care waqf using waqf; save households, by creating a social safety net and graduation program using zakat-infaq; save businesses, especially micro-small enterprises (MSEs), through financial and business assistance (especially digital marketing) leveraging zakat-infaq-waqf and save financial institutions, especially micro-small financial institutions, by the development of cash waqf and the adoption of fintech and IICSF, especially in Islamic financial institutions targeting MSEs. Research limitations/implications: This study is exploratory in nature, which needs further investigations using more sophisticated qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Practical implications: If the above programs using ISF instruments are implemented, the economic surplus would be re-established and the acceleration of economic recovery can be realized. Social implications: The successful adoption of ISF could at the same time reduce poverty, accelerate MSEs development and improve equitable well-being. Originality/value: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused health, economic and social problems, which must be solved holistically, including ISF within IICSF. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 405 scientific papers on zakat recorded in the Scopus database until 2021. Various tools have been used – Microsoft Excel for frequency analysis, VOSviewer for data visualization, and Harzing’s Publish or Perish for metrics and citation analysis. This study finds that the number of zakat literature has increased significantly and consistently over the last ten years. The fields of Social Science, Business, Management, Accounting, Economics, and Finance are areas where zakat literature often appears in and is based in countries in the US, Europe and Asia. English is used in most zakat literature, along with several other languages like Malay, Arabic, German, Indonesian, Slovak, and Turkish. Research results also indicate that the zakat literature is mainly found in the subject areas of economics, finance, management, and accounting. The use of keywords such as zakat, Malaysia, zakat institution, poverty alleviation, zakat distribution, zakat management, social welfare, education, efficiency, and human are widespread. This study also found that Malaysia, Indonesia, America, Saudi Arabia, and Britain have become the five countries that have played a major role in creating collaborative zakat research. The findings of this study provide important implications for improving the practice and reach of zakat globally. © 2022. Global Journal Al-Thaqafah. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Zakat (Islamic almsgiving) plays a considerable role in dealing with the socioeconomic issues in times of COVID-19 pandemic, and such roles have been widely discussed in virtual events. This paper aims to discover knowledge of the current global zakat administration from virtual events of zakat (e.g. webinars) on YouTube and Zoom via text mining approach. Design/methodology/approach: The authors purposefully sampled 12 experts from four different virtual zakat events on YouTube and Zoom. The automated text transcription software is used to pull the information from the sampled videos into text documents. A qualitative analysis is operated using text mining approach via machine learning tool (i.e. Orange Data Mining). Four research questions are developed under the Word Cloud visualisation, hierarchal clustering, topic modelling and graph and network theory. Findings: The machine learning identifies the most important words, the relationship between the experts and their top words and discovers hidden themes from the sample. This finding is practically substantial for zakat stakeholders to understand the current issues of global zakat administration and to learn the applicable lessons from the current issues of zakat management worldwide. Research limitations/implications: This study does not establish a positivist generalisation from the findings because of the nature and objective of the study. Practical implications: A policy implication is drawn pertaining to the legislation of zakat as an Islamic financial policy instrument for combating poverty in Muslim society. Social implications: This work supports the notion of “socioeconomic zakat”, implying that zakat as a religious obligation is important in shaping the social and economic processes of a Muslim community. Originality/values: This work marks the novelty in making sense of the unstructured data from virtual events on YouTube and Zoom in the Islamic social finance research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The object under study is a waqf managed by the Muhammadiyah Regional Board (PDM) of Lumajang East Java, Indonesia; a gas station business unit called SPBU Shirkah Amānah. PDM of Lumajang is taken as the subject of research because it has succeeded in managing profitable and productive waqf in business entities, and is playing a role in the community's economic empowerment. In this study, the data is collected through interviews, document reviews, and observations. The findings of this study show that creative innovation in developing productive waqf both in the form of business entities and business cooperation models conducted by PDM of Lumajang can generate a significant contribution in opening new jobs and investment. Further, it can also increase the community's financial income, increase social service facilities, and provide financial contribution to the sustainability of religious and social activities. Accordingly, it is argued that this productive waqf is likely able to play a significant role in the empowerment of the community's economy and might also be adapted to be a pilot model for productive waqf management. © 2021.

This study aims to explore the implementation of Corporate Waqf Core Principles (CWCP), a set of sharia principles for corporate waqf implemented in the growth of waqf in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative research with a specific focus on comparative analysis of the advantages of waqf management at two different institutions that develop corporate waqf, Waqf Board Foundation of Universitas Islam Indonesia (YBW UII) Yogyakarta and Pesantren Tebuireng in Jombang. YBW UII Yogyakarta has developed productive waqf assets and immovable objects through professional and profitable multi-company institutions, ensuring that the waqf’s results expand and the benefits fly. Pesantren Tebuireng, on the other hand, understands the implementation of CWCP in the framework of productive waqf administration and management by conceptualizing the productivity of waqf assets through corporate and institutional management. The two models of waqf management methods ensure that waqf management within the corporate institutional framework is more productive and produces long-term outcomes and benefits. However, there are certain deviations in the implementation of the CWCP which has not used shares as waqf assets. The development of this waqf model in Indonesia can accelerate community economic development. © 2022 Miftahul Huda and Lukman Santoso.},

The research further uses an Islamic microfinance window based in Kyrgyzstan as a case study. The empirical data and analysis indicates that Islamic microfinance contributes to serving many key aspects of maqāsid al-shari'a, including: (1) Poverty reduction (2) economy enhancement (3) enhancing social condition of society (4) wealth distribution and circulation, and (5) enhancing intellectual levels of society. This research may have contributed to knowledge by possibly being one of the first researches analyzing the impact of Islamic microfinance on maqāsid al-shari'a, by using contemporary empirical data from Kyrgyzstan (2017 onwards) as a case study. © 2020 The Authors},

The paper aims at accessing the potential of Islamic microfinance for the purpose of achieving the economic empowerment in Tunisia. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire survey method is used. The method is intended for some of the beneficiaries of Zitouna Tamkeen (ZT), the only Islamic microfinance institution in Tunisia. Responses are analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences program. Findings: The authors infer that though the Islamic and conventional microfinance have similar objectives, the methods are different. What is more, the economic empowerment requires not only financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, but also skill development. The results of the survey reveal that ZT has contributed to certain economic empowerment of most of ZT's beneficiaries. In addition, the authors bring to the fore that providing supportive infrastructure and investment is a prominent component of the economic empowerment process. Research limitations/implications: In the paper, the sample is limited. Practical implications: The authors have highlighted that some structural barriers to entrepreneurship – such as legal, operational and marketing challenges – need to be addressed in a practical way.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mixed-method research framework. The authors use a systematic literature review following the recommendations of Bowen (2009) to identify critical challenges financing PPP projects using SRI Sukuk. In the next phase, the authors interview participants involved in an SRI Sukuk financed PPP project to get more significant insights on the challenges identified through the literature review process. Findings: The authors identify the need for greater transparency for SRI financed PPP projects. Also, organisational and legislative challenges are limiting the attractiveness of SRI Sukuk as a financing mechanisms for post-COVID development projects. Practical implications: SRI Sukuk is an emerging financing concept, and the use of such an Islamic financial instrument in financing development projects can serve as a viable alternative for policymakers in a post-COVID economic environment. Social implications: The successful completion of the development projects integrating the concept of Social Maslahah through SRI Sukuk in Malaysia could encourage other emerging economies to use such innovative Islamic financial instrument for economic development in post-COVID environment.

Interview, observation, and secondary data are used to acquire data; descriptive methods are used to analyze the data, and the research findings are fed back into the grand theory.

This study is a normative legal study using the maslāhah mursalah approach. The data analyzed is literature from books of fiqh scholars, textbooks, scientific journals, and other sources. Result of this study shows that Islam can regulate the management of zakat assets through the socio-economic empowerment of the people, preventing wealth accumulation in one group and reducing poverty. Mustahik, previously limited to short-term goals and institutional charity, now appears to have long-term benefits, including reducing poverty and empowering the community's economy. Mustahik is also useful for marginalized people, people with disabilities, and people experiencing moral and social deprivation, including mental health. The fact that the spread of this group is not limited to social media, but has also spread to campuses, schools, and being part of modern lifestyle needs urgent responses from various stakeholders, particularly in distributing zakat for LGBT community in Indonesia. The LGBT group is a legal reality that arises due to psychological and medical factors and entities caused by deviant associations. This research contributes to the Indonesian government's strategic steps to address the LGBT through zakat empowerment. So that in this way the group slowly through rehabilitation using zakat they experience awareness about life behavior that is in accordance with Islamic law in a dignified way. © 2021 Scripta Judaica Cracoviensia.

This paper also examines waqf-related legal references of Guinea and other countries and analyses relevant online sources such as journal articles, research papers, webpages as well as informal discussions with persons informed on the subject matter within and outside the Republic of Guinea. Findings: This paper identifies a number of prevailing issues affecting the development of the institution of waqf in the Republic of Guinea and, thereafter, proposes key reformatory measures. These include the passing of general codified legislation that comprehensively governs waqf affairs in the country and the setting up of a dedicated supervisory entity and competent managerial bodies to ensure the smooth and effective operation of the institution in the country.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess enterprise risk management (ERM) practices in waqf institutions (WIs) along with their strengths and weaknesses; highlight ERM trends in WIs; and determine the best ERM practices for these institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via structured interviews with nine WI managers in Malaysia. A standardised questionnaire was adopted for the interviews, which focussed on ERM implementation in WIs. The collected data were analysed in three steps, namely, data reduction, data display and verification/conclusion. The frequency distribution of these data were then illustrated and the mean values and differences of the studied groups/variables were examined. Findings: WIs have a sub-optimal ERM implementation, whose aspects need to be improved over time. These institutions have focussed on their ERM practices at the strategic level yet ignored those at the operational level. Specifically, WI officers have well-defined internal environments and objectives, but risk monitoring, which ensures effective implementation of ERM, is lacking. The presence of risk management committees and units may be linked with the successful implementation of ERM. However, ERM knowledge and top management support do not show clearly associations with ERM implementation. WIs should focus on improving their ERM implementation governance. Research limitations/implications: Findings underscore the need for WIs to launch a formal ERM programme and for relevant stakeholders to create the appropriate infrastructures that support ERM implementation, including amended rules, ERM policies and allocated funds for training and education, to promote ERM implementation knowledge and awareness. The successful implementation of ERM not only improves the service quality, sustainability and performance of WIs but also promotes the national waqf agenda as a key economic driver. Originality/value: ERM in non-profit organisations, such as WIs, has received limited research attention relative to that in profit-driven organisations despite having unique risks. To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first to identify those trends that explain ERM practices and to determine the ERM best practices of WIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It considers Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) as the study setting and adopts a quantitative approach involving 120 women microentrepreneurs. The questionnaire was distributed to women micro-entrepreneurs in Selangor state employing a convenience sampling method. The model was analysed utilising the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that Islamic microfinancing, human capital, and ICT usage positively influence the performance of women micro-entrepreneurs. The empirical findings enhance the literature by extending the resource-based view (RBV), a soft theory in the organisational theory literature, by incorporating Islamic microfinancing in the context. It is hoped the study will assist IMFIs and governments in strengthening infrastructures, developing comprehensive business strategies, and educating women micro-entrepreneurs about the possibilities of the digital economy for long-term business sustainability and development. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

This is in line with the existence of regulations that support the effectiveness of its role in poverty reduction in Indonesia, such as Law No. 23 of 2011 on Zakat Management and Law No. 41 of 2004 on Waqf. This study has two objectives. First, to analyze the impact of Islamic philanthropy on poverty reduction as the socio-economic problems in Indonesia in the short and long run. Second, to analyze the effectiveness of integrated Islamic commercial and social-economic or finance to address the poverty compared to unintegrated one. This study used Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to analyze annual data for the period of 2002-2019 while investigating the long and short-run relationships among variables. It found that Islamic philanthropy reduces poverty both in the short and long run, particularly in the integration of Islamic social and commercial finance in a single model. The government should therefore include Islamic philanthropy or other Islamic social finances as a fundamental strategy for building financial stability and sustainable development.

It explained the types of feudalism and indicated what leads to ownership or not. Moreover, It includes a list of the legal controls of feudalism and presents it during the reign of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the guided caliphs. The study assumed that feudalism is one of the state’s regulatory tools for the development of endowment institutions with financial solvency, and a means to involve them in development, to establish facilities by investing endowment funds, whether in inhabited cities or in deserted remote areas, opening new investment horizons, and stimulating the construction of new housing and the manufacture of equipment, reclamation, and trading in it, encouraging immigration to it, and stimulating trade around its endowment institutions. This is because waqf institutions provide basic necessary services at no cost to the state. There for, the study discussed the possibility of compatibility of the concept of waqf and the concept of feudalism within its legal limits and their complementarity to achieve reconstruction. At the level of endowment management decisions or endowment investment management. Then the study concluded by presenting the experience of King Abdulaziz Endowment for Al Ain Al Azizia in Jeddah as a contemporary model for the integration between endowment and feudalism, mentioning the results and recommendations. © (2023), (Journal of King Abdulaziz University).

	abstract = {Efficiency is essential for an institution because it can measure how well resources are used to achieve its specific goals (Wahab & Rahman, 2011). Zakat institutions must be managed efficiently, so they are maximized in promoting socio-economic goals, especially poverty alleviation (Wahab & Rahman, 2013). This study aims to analyze the efficiency level of Baitul Mal districts/cities of Aceh Province in Indonesia. Efficiency measurement uses a nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach during 2018–2020. DEA analyzes the interaction between input variables consisting of socialization costs, number of amil, and operational costs, with output variables comprising the total collection and distribution of zakat, infaq, and sadaqah (ZIS). The results show that 11 Baitul Mal out of 69 decision-making unit (DMU) (15.94%) are efficient overall, technical, and scale. As for technical efficiency, there are 16 Baitul Mal (23.19%) that are efficient, the remaining 26 Baitul Mal (40.58%) have a score below 60, and 27 Baitul Mal (36.23%) have a score above 60. Regency Baitul Mal Aceh Besar became the only Baitul Mal that achieved efficiency throughout the research period. The source of Baitul Mal’s inefficiency comes from all variables. Baitul Mal must optimize socialization costs by 60.68%, operational costs by 33.60%, and the role of amil by 3.20%. Furthermore, Baitul Mal must increase the amount of ZIS collection by 46.29% and the distribution of ZIS by 52.84% to achieve efficiency. © 2023, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.},

This study examines how Islamic philanthropy organizations in Indonesia that collect, manage, and distribute zakat, sedekah, and waqf have adapted to the global pandemic to continue serving people in need in urban areas by using digital platforms. The use of technology has accelerated philanthropic practices, ranging from fundraising, distributing, and delivering services to coordinating duties and responsibilities during the pandemic, especially in an urban area such as Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. By focusing on the experiences of two leading Islamic philanthropy organizations, Badan Amil Zakat Nasional and Dompet Dhuafa, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia, this study reveals that Islamic philanthropic organizations have adopted several changes and innovations by embracing technology.

Consequently, this study hopes to contribute to the development of waqf institutions in terms of human capital proficiency, the efficiency of operations and the effectiveness and sustainability of performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reviewed a significant body of relevant studies written on various aspects of IC, to highlight the significance of considering IC in the operation of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and waqf institutions. Findings: This study highlights the importance of IC in the operation of waqf institutions. It provides a platform that facilitates understanding of the existing obstacles and challenges in waqf institutions (such as lack of accountability, lack of funding, mismanagement and lack of trained labour, among others) and offers potential solutions through the consideration of knowledge and IC. Research limitations/implications: This study is a conceptual analysis of IC in the context of NPOs. Future studies should conduct empirical testing, which will provide more detailed discussion and enriching insights into the issue of IC and the performance of NPOs, particularly in the case of waqf institutions. Practical implications: This study provides several important implications for waqf institutions and other NPOs, as it sheds light on the consideration of knowledge and IC in their operations.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to propose a model for a financing guarantee scheme (FGS) funded by the voluntary sector (through zakat, infaq, and sadaqah, or ZIS funds) to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We argue that the existing credit guarantee scheme (CGS) relies on government funding, but that in the current Covid-19 pandemic it is experiencing unstable financial capability. Hence, the sustainability of the CGS program is questionable. We employ the input-output (I-O) approach to identify the expected impact if the proposed FGS is applied. We further substantiate the proposal with seven Indonesian Syariah experts’ opinions, of whom five suggest that the alternative scheme is acceptable. The simulation using I-O shows that if IDR1 trillion (out of IDR10 trillion from ZIS funds in 2019) is disbursed through the scheme, this will increase economic growth by 0.0117%, representing economic activities worth IDR1.235 trillion, and creating 2,151 new jobs. We further discuss the implications of the findings for the Islamic banking industry in the future and for regulators. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite the fact that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in strengthening the financial sector within developing and emerging economies through providing employment opportunities to the rural and urban population, capacity building in the form of skills training and economic empowerment, they still face a plethora of challenges that continue to threaten their existence, performance and growth. Access to operational and administrative funds needed to execute their activities effectively is a significant challenge and detrimental to the growth of SMEs in Uganda. Conversely, Islamic microfinance has been noted as a panacea to the challenges of financial inaccessibility among SMEs, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate how the adoption of Islamic microfinance can play a fundamental role in enhancing the sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) while meeting the financing challenges of SMEs in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a review of existing literature was carried out to critically examine relevant information (literature sources) and empirical studies on SMEs, their performance and challenges. The study being conceptual tries to understand how Islamic microfinance could be adopted as an alternative scheme of financing to bridge the gap and mitigate the financial challenges facing SMEs. Findings: The study finds that the existing MFIs have failed to achieve their objectives of providing financial services to the poor and SMEs while remaining sustainable. This has left the majority of SMEs within Uganda's informal sector financially handicapped, thus leading to their failure in meeting their expectations and eventually collapsing even before celebrating their third or fourth birthdays. However, the enactment into law of the Financial Institutions Amendment Act 2016 that paved the way for the introduction of Islamic finance in Uganda, and the Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions and Money Lenders' Act, 2016 that incorporated the aspects of Islamic microfinance within the existing microfinance framework as seen and is perceived as a key factor in addressing the financial challenges faced by MFIs and the SMEs if fully adopted. Research limitations/implications: This study is conceptual with no empirical investigation and discussion of key theories. On the contrary, it will be imperative and useful when carrying out more extensive hypothetical studies by future researchers, specifically in the area of Islamic microfinance that is relatively new in Uganda. Practical implications: Practically, this paper will serve as a guide to policymakers and practitioners in the field of microfinance by adding a flair that could enable in bridging the challenges associated with inadequate financing of SMEs in Uganda. Social implications: Socially, the social aspects of charity (Zakah and Sadaqah) will help to improve the livelihood of the poorest of the poor who cannot engage in active business through meeting their basic needs of life without begging thereby preventing them from being social outcasts. Originality/value: The study establishes Islamic microfinance (IMF) as a promising and unexplored viable option potentially needed in intensifying the financing needs of SMEs in Uganda. The paper provides an entirely new dimension in nature and way microfinance products should be structured with a view of ensuring that there is sustainable provision of financial services to SMEs. The paper adds real value to the existing conventional microfinance products and services in Uganda, given the ethical and moral attributes of Islamic microfinancing practices that are assumed to efficiently and effectively motivate SME owners and other small entrepreneurs to thrive. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Efforts by global society to improve financial inclusion amongst the underprivileged have gained traction, but challenges abound to prevent a comprehensive success. Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging fintech industry brings about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees. Despite the introduction of disruptive fintech services, the needs generated by unimproved conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic fintech has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary (waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how fintech start-ups in Finland and Malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major fintech sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (P2P) financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances fintech services to elevate social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding, changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest that Islamic fintech offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance decisions. © 2020 SERSC.},

	abstract = {Zakat potential in Indonesia reaches IDR 252 trillion per year. With the amount of 202 million Muslims, this can alleviate poverty in Indonesia. However, zakat has not been optimized by the government. This is indicated by the low tax revenue which is around USD 86 Million per month or IDR 2.8 Trillion per year. Low zakat collection is partly caused by the lack of trust to zakat management institutions (called LPZ), LPZ’s professionalism, and zakat direct distribution by muzakki to mustahik. In addition, people worry that their funds will be corrupted. It is because corruption is closely related to government’s image; shown by abundant cases of corruption involving well-known figures. This article discusses the role of zakat in alleviating poverty and reinforcing Baznas as public’s reliable Amil Zakat Institution (BAZ). The result indicated that the professionalism of services and management of BAZ and LAZ can be created by improving their performance to gain community trust. One effort of empowering BAZ as public trust is through the internal and external reinforcement. Baznas internal reinforcement can be done by tightening Human Resource recruitment and assessment by national and international accreditation agencies. Meanwhile, external reinforcement is done by creating innovation and program rebranding. © 2020, Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang. All rights reserved.},

This paper thus aims to explore the degree to which the toilet construction project has benefitted its recipients. This case study of BAZNAS’s project in Kendel, Boyolali, Indonesia, employs a qualitative approach based on participatory observation and semi-structured interviews. The findings explain the perspectives of local community after receiving the assistance, including the identification of reduction in numbers of local people affected by diarrhoea. This information may validate the relationships between health, water and sanitation. Furthermore, the findings capture the involvement of local government in the project execution. Thus, social and practical implications are revealed by this study.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to deliberate on the establishment of zakat (Islamic alms) on oil and gas in Malaysia. Being one of the five Islamic pillars, zakat contributes significantly to the country’s socio-economic development and prosperity. However, in Malaysia and other Islamic countries, there is not yet a proper mechanism for calculating zakat on extracted minerals. Similar to gold and silver, oil and gas are valuable minerals, which, upon extraction, are subject to zakat payment. In Malaysia, however, this is not the case. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative method. It presents a thorough review on the stipulation for paying zakat on minerals, specifically oil and gas. The deliberation is based on secondary data entailing a comprehensive content analysis of prominent books on the subject, current zakat rulings and legal acts on oil and gas. Findings: Oil and gas are subject to zakat payment, as indicated in several Qurʾānic verses and based on the academic reasoning of Muslim scholars. The zakat calculation for oil and gas entails the nisāb (minimum threshold value of the assets) but not the ḥawl (the requirement for one full Islamic year of ownership for the assets), by analogy with zakat on agricultural produce. Despite the obligation to pay zakat on minerals under the zakāt al-māl (alms due on wealth) category, oil and gas is yet to be fully subject to this practice in Malaysia, although the country is known as an oil-producing Muslim country. Several legislative acts covering the managerial and business side of oil and gas operations have long been established, but the provision on zakat remains unclear. Hence, comprehensive legislation is needed to fine-tune the Malaysian oil and gas system, particularly with regard to zakat. Research limitations/implications: This study relies mainly on secondary data and literature without performing any empirical investigations. Practical implications: In terms of academic implication, this study enriches the existing body of knowledge on zakat. Practical implications would include enhanced decision-making concerning zakat on oil and gas on the part of zakat institutions, policymakers and the government of Malaysia. Originality/value: This study provides practical and academic contributions to the deep understanding of zakat on oil and gas, which has received very little attention in the existing body of literature. Despite being limited in literature, this is a breakthrough study that sheds light on zakat on oil and gas. © 2021, Pg Mohd Faezul Fikri Ag Omar, Haneffa Muchlis Gazali, Mohd.

This research employed a post-positivist paradigm. Data observation was performed by conducting an in-depth interview with several informants. The data analysis utilized an interactive model technique. The research results showed that i-CSR was successfully implemented in the Islamic microfinance institution based on Islamic boarding school due to the mutual passion (convergence) with conventional CSR typologies. The convergence is in two ways, firstly managerial behavior that focuses on protecting company stakeholders, second, creating sustainable corporate values through effective and efficient business activities. The orientation is the creation of a social role based on justice and sustainable development. The convergence is mainly in the dimensions of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. The Islamic values have enriched the implementation of i-CSR as the form of practicing the teachings of Islam and evidence of human servitude to God so that the behaviors become worthy of worship. The implementation of i-CSR focused on the Islamic teachings. Compliance to Islamic jurisprudence and apply it in business activities became a divergent element of conventional CSR concept. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. },

	abstract = {The principle aim of this paper is to look at the concept of tamlīk from two dimensions: tamlīk by the recipient of zakat and tamlīk by the plenipotentiary or the organisation deputised to distribute the zakat-money on behalf of the British zakat-payer. The body deputised to distribute zakat has a religio-ethical duty of distributing the zakat-money it has taken possession of, in order to meet the allocative function outlined in the Qur’an. This paper questions whether British Muslim charities are currently being effective agents in achieving poverty reduction. It questions whether the British Muslim charities’ modus operandi of distributing of zakat-money does empower the poor. This paper argues that cash distribution should be considered a primary method of zakat distribution unless there are exceptional circumstances to do otherwise. It further argues that zakat in cash is far more effective in addressing poverty and empowering the poor than the status quo. © 2021 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

	abstract = {Poverty is a crucial and worldwide phenomenon. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship exists between socio-economic factors, social factors, and poverty, the relative influence of economic and social factors on poverty and to describe causality between time series in the VAR system. This study utilized the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) by using quarterly time-series data, 1994Q1 to 2018Q4, that have been collected from the world development indicators (WDI) and Economic Survey of Pakistan. The study identified education, unemployment, inflation as economic factors while zakat and rainfall as social factors that can reduce poverty. The findings of this study indicate that inflation and unemployment have a positive and significant relationship with poverty in the long run in Pakistan while education, rainfall, social welfare programs, and zakat has a negative relationship in the long run with poverty. Besides, the study also found that in the short run, there is no relationship between economic and social factors with poverty. Moreover, the study found that in the long run that the relative contribution of education and rain increases, 28% and 20%, is greater than the contribution of inflation, social welfare programs, unemployment and zakat, 3.8%, 0.5%, 2.5%, and 0.08%. Similarly, its contribution to poverty reduces up to 44% in the long run. This study helps policymakers to take important decisions about economic and social factors while designing policies to reduce poverty. The results suggest that the state bank of Pakistan should adopt a contractionary monetary policy to control inflation and policymakers can develop policies like education for all. The government should develop a business environment to create more employment opportunities. © 2021 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

This study contributes to the Indonesia Financial Service Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) policies concerning the need for implementing ethical values in sharia banking and other sharia financial entities based on the philanthropic model, this study posits that firms undertaking zakat and charity are ethical firms. The population of this study is 8 sharia banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2014-2018. The result of the study showed that zakat disclosure significantly affected financial performance. Moreover, ethical values that were proxied by CSR disclosure did not significantly affect financial performance. The limitation of the study is the limited number of the sample; therefore, it is expected that the future research adds other sharia financial entities and adds the dimension of management, sustainability, product, and the environment as benchmarks of ethical values. The originality of this study offers an additional explanation of the relationship between ethical values and performance by investigating zakat and CSR disclosure which is a unique factor in Indonesia. © 2021.

Second, the rahmatan lil 'alamin in Islamic economics law can be manifested by organizing social services, such as waqf, relying on the spirit of building justice in life, narrowing social gaps, as well as enlivening Islamic values.

	abstract = {Purpose: Waqf played a powerful Islamic social finance instrument throughout Islamic history. However, the popularity of waqf declined in recent years. It is essential to understand the past research, the research gaps and the waqf’s ignorant research areas within the existing literature to enhance the waqf system. Therefore, this study aims to carry a detailed analysis of waqf research development with a careful evaluation of the scientific panorama’s different aspects inherent in Islamic business and social finance. Design/methodology/approach: Scientometrics is a discipline that studies the quantitative characteristics and characteristics of science and technological research, technology and innovation. This research’s string includes waqf as a reference in the “Article title, Abstract and Keywords” based on Scopus from 1990 to 2020. The analysis was conducted in December 2020. The Bibliometrix R Package, VOSviewer and Excel’s software are used to analyse the collected data and apply the bibliometric analysis. Findings: The findings derive that waqf research can be categorized into three sub-areas, such as the research on waqf fundamentals, analysis on cash waqf and research on various waqf applications in Islamic social finance. Even though there is some essential or fundamental research in waqf, these are not good enough for such a powerful Islamic social finance instrument. This study finds research gaps in the existing waqf literature and presents nine future research directions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to examine waqf’s existing literature with bibliometric analysis. The results and the recommended possible research areas can help scholars and researchers to carry future research to enhance the scientific development of Islamic social finance and provide alternative instruments to eradicate poverty in societies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The data is collected from documents such as books, research article and brochure, and from author observation from time to time. This paper identifies that the educational thought and experiences of Imam Zarkasyi as well as his religious inclination played an important role in his modernization of pesantren. The research also found that Imam Zarkasyi's thought and practices in modernizing Pesantren system started from his serious observation and evaluation as well as his appreciation of traditional pesantren and madrasah system of education. The step taken by Imam Zarkasyi to modernize the education system was by integrating pesantren and madrasah system. In modernizing curriculum Imam Zarkasyi integrated the formal, non-formal and informal education utilizing pesantren environment. Students are taught not only subjects on religion and general sciences in the classroom, but also obtaining morality, mental and job skill education and other values in pesantren tradition within a well-designed informal and non-formal education. Finally, to ensure the sustainability of pesantren Imam Zarkasyi changed the status of Pesantren institution from personal ownership into public property by way Waqf. The thought had been practically implemented successfully in secondary level and now the Waqf Board started to implement the practice at university level. © 2020 STAIN Kudus. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The foundational principle of Islam is Rahman and the beloved Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him) has been sent as rahmatan Lil Alamin, mercy to all mankind. It is upon this principle that Islam incorporates different programs that will make life comfortable for all mankind. These kinds of programs include Sadaqah, Zakat, and by extension Waqf. The latter has been used in many countries such as Malaysia, Turkey, Kuwait, etc. as a way of alleviating poverty, bridging the socio-economic gap, and empower masses especially the vulnerable. As the whole world was unexpectedly sparked by the novel pandemic, COVID 19, every country has been on toe not only to protect her habitants and city but also to render assistance on the basic needs. Some countries like Nigeria have been overwhelmed in successfully carrying out this task. They become “lone wolf” in this situation. This paper assesses how the pandemic affects the livelihood of people in Lagos state in Nigeria and the reliefs provided by the government to help the situation. It is thus revealed that Lagos State has the highest number of coronavirus cases with more than ten thousand cases. The pandemic affected the source of income of people and everyone finds it difficult to meet ends meet. The government has supported people through cash transfer and food distribution. However, it is found that the government alone was on the ‘battlefield’ making the matter complicated and the relief provided insubstantial. It is on this base that this study recommends creation of Waqf institution to provide complementary role in such situation and beyond. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This study found that the asnaf receives very minimum assistance and that can hardly empower them. Accordingly, it’s imperative that the fund needs to be geared towards long term productive use. The results support that the institutional contributory performance (ICP) having a positive effect, and the level of sustainable development of zakat recipients (SDZR) do increase after receiving zakat, but there are issues that need careful addressing. The study further examined the moderating role of demographic factors, such as earnings, age, marital status and gender, and witnessed that after zakat, all parameters improved, though individual moderating variables yet to show any significance. The study initiated a newer dimension through incorporating before-zakat and after-zakat scenarios in examining the comparative impact on SDZR, and likewise understanding the recipient’s level of Islamic self-actualisation. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {Zakat is an instrument of Islamic economic and social funds that contributes to the achievement of people wellbeing. This study examines the business growth as a mediating variable on the relationship between the impact of the zakat empowerment programs and mustahiq’s (zakat recipient) welfare. This quantitative study employs Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis on 100 mustahiqs from different zakat empowerment programs in East Java and DI Yogyakarta. Zakat empowerment positively affects mustahiq’s welfare. This indicates that the empowerment program successfully increases mustahiqs’ wellbeing and their business. Business growth as a mediating variable on the relationship between business assistantship and mustahiq welfare also shows a positive and significant effect. Further, macroeconomic indicators consisting of GRDP and inflation and internal factors consisting of age and educational level, have different impacts on the business growth of mustahiq. This study confirms the zakat empowerment program’s role in improving the mustahiq’s welfare based on maqashid al-shariah (the Islamic objectives). Zakat community empowerment is a solution to suppress the poverty rate and possible for reducing inequality and ending poverty in Indonesia. This study extends the literature by providing a unique measurement of mustahiq welfare. This study incorporates maqashid al-shariah considerations to measure the wellbeing. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Indonesia as a country with the largest Muslim population in the world has an Islamic microfinance concept that has a strategic role in carrying out the triple bottom line mission, namely economic development, community empowerment, and preaching (da'wah). In practice, Indonesia has a unique microfinance concept called Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil (BMT) which is an Islamic microfinance concept that carries out a commercial orientation through tamwil activities and social orientation through maal activities. The importance of the sustainability of BMT performance in Indonesia, this requires a model framework that is in accordance with the characteristics of the company to direct, manage, and assess the operations of the Accounting Information System (AIS) to achieve sustainability performance.

	abstract = {Loan portfolio is the largest asset component and a source of risk that a microfinance institution needs to treat carefully. The quality of the loan portfolio is very crucial as the loans are typically not backed by any physical collateral. Having dual roles of achieving social and financial objectives, lenders require the microfinance institutions to have long-Term financial sustainability. The study aims to gauge whether financial risks of Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions are pro-cyclical to economic conditions. The study utilises the dataset of 39 microfinance institutions for Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan from 2007 to 2013. Findings indicate that financial risks are pro-cyclical with economic conditions for both Islamic and conventional banking institutions. However, Islamic microfinance institutions are exposed to a higher financial risk during an economic downturn. This implies that Islamic microfinance institutions should improve the quality of their portfolio to preserve sustainability and resilience. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

It is interesting to study the implementation of economic justice through waqf and how its regulation in Indonesia. This article employed normative juridical method. Based on the Article 22 of the Law Number 41 of 2004 on Waqf, the purpose of waqf is not solely for the purpose of ritual. It can also be used to realize economic prosperity. Based on these provisions, waqf can be managed for the economic empowerment of the people. This is related to the efforts of the improvement of the economic welfare of the people, especially for the weak economic class. According to Islamic teachings, distributive justice is economic justice based on the Holy Quran, Chapter al-Hasyr (59): 7. Waqf has the potential to create the economic balance of society. Because the principle of ownership, according to Islam, regulates that individuals or certain community members are not the only party who control the management of assets. The weak economic class also have the right. It is to avoid economic inequality. Thus, waqf is a solution to actualize economic justice in order to realize public welfare, which is one of Indonesia’s national goals as stated in the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, Padjadjaran University.

The data waere collected through a questionnaire that was distributed to 600 respondents in six districts or cities in two provinces. Respondents were randomly selected at the village level. The results showed that social solidarity during Ramadan was high (3.32) with values of the spirit of togetherness (3.37), collective consciousness (3.32) and cooperation (3.28). In addition, philanthropy was included in a high category (3.27) with different values of alms (3.49), infaq (3.23) and waqf (3.10). Therefore, it can be concluded that Ramadan contributes positively to the social solidarity of Muslim communities in Indonesia. The result can be used to develop a model of social solidarity in overcoming the problem of disintegration. Furthermore, it improves Muslim philanthropy for social welfare and to overcome the problem of poverty.

This ethnographic case study of a contemporary zakat foundation in India traces how zakat occasions the experimental formation of Islamic social ethics, including a critique of gender. Donors of zakat attempt to move beyond merely helping the poor through the redistribution of resources. They reconfigure the giving of zakat to affect the structural conditions of poverty by generating a counter-cultural critique of the practice of giving dowry. Such efforts disclose how zakat can function as a practical theodicy, a way to counter the normalized evil of assigned disposability. By encouraging reflexivity and responsiveness, the obligation to distribute zakat becomes framed as a way to disrupt precarity. Copyright © 2018 Danielle Widmann Abraham},

This study explains how the role of digital zakat technology in the National Amil Zakat Agency (BAZNAS) in Indonesia through the Islamic economic approach includes the relationship between humans and the social environment. This study also explains how the relationship between the values of faith, sharia, and morals can influence perspectives on (1) acceptance of digital zakat technology; (2) zakat education; (3) the socio-economic environment. Zakat digital technology is formed by the development of multidimensional digitalization where people tend to use the internet for various economic activities. There is an assumption that technology has a negative impact on society, but other facts prove that technology can also have a positive impact on economic development. Zakat as an obligation for Muslims has a positive impact on the welfare of the community based on the value of justice in the distribution of wealth. Digital zakat is present as an efficient step to facilitate the management of zakat. Studies prove that digital zakat can increase the potential for receiving zakat significantly and the public also supports the implementation of digital zakat technology as an alternative management of zakat. © (2020).

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the existing Islamic financial technology (fintech) lending in Indonesia. Doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: This study engages qualitative methods. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of Islamic fintech. Further, the existing literature of SDGs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in Indonesia. Following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of Islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition. The selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the SDGs. Finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of Indonesia in implementing SDGs. Findings: This work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute Islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community. In some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms’ effort in promoting SDG of ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and reducing the inequalities (SDG 10). Research limitations/implications: The discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used. Practical implications: The Indonesian Government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in SDG 15 (life on land). Social implications: This work elaborates in what way the Islamic fintech lending has been promoting the SDGs in Indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in Indonesia. Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of Islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of SDGs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Zakat plays an undeniably significant role in social life. The enforcement of zakah in early Islamic history is evidence that it is a powerful tool for fostering economic growth. The economy under the reign of Caliphate Umar Ibn Abdul Azis even achieved a surplus, with no one having the right to receive zakah. Recent studies have attempted to link the role of zakah and economic growth qualitatively by arguing that zakah can contribute to economic development. However, the extent to which it has a multiplier effect on economic growth has not been examined. Considering this research gap, this study examines such an effect on economic growth, as represented by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To capture the full impact of zakah on aggregate production, two scenarios are conducted, namely the economy with and without zakah. The simulation results show that zakah can promote aggregate production. On the other hand, the economy experiences lower aggregate production when there is no zakah. An agent-based computational model (ABM) simulation is employed to run the simulation. The application of ABM in this study is intended to introduce the use of computational study as an alternative method of developing research in Islamic economics. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the determinants of intention to adopt Islamic microfinance among prospective customers in Nigeria, to enhance access to formal financial services. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative study used the proportionate stratified random sampling technique to collect data from 450 respondents, using close-ended questionnaires. The data was analyzed using analysis of moment structures-structural equation modeling. The decomposed theory of planned behavior (DTPB) was used as the underlying theory to test 10 hypotheses. Findings: Results showed the intention toward the adoption of Islamic microfinance is high in Nigeria. In total, 8 of the 10 study hypotheses were supported, out of which attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control were found to have a positive and significant influence on the behavioral intention to adopt Islamic microfinance. Consequently, the study recommends the need for stakeholders in the Nigerian financial system to embark on enlightenment campaigns that will improve the public attitude on the role of Islamic microfinance banks in the promotion of financial inclusion and poverty reduction. Research limitations/implications: The study focused specifically on three selected states in Northern Nigeria that are predominantly Muslim. The findings and indeed the conclusions of the study, may not be suitable for generalization to other parts of the country. Practical implications: The study found that three constructs: attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were found to affect behavioral intention. Thus, the Central Bank of Nigeria and Islamic financial institutions should tailor their enlightenment campaigns toward improving public attitude on the need to adopt Islamic microfinance banks to further enhance financial inclusion, and thus reduce the incidence of poverty. Islamic microfinance banks should complement their commercial products and services with Islamic social finance products such as Sadaqat, Zakat and benevolent loan, as is the practice in jurisdictions where Islamic finance is institutionalized. Social implications: The social implication of the study is its ability to determine factors that will enhance financial inclusion in Nigeria. This will assist in reducing poverty and income inequality. Originality/value: The study was also able to extend the DTPB by introducing awareness as an additional latent construct in explaining attitude. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Kabir Hassan’s productivity, citations, collaborations with fellow researchers, publications, and content analysis with future research direction in conjunction with his 30th academic anniversary which is marked in 2021. The bibliometric and thematic analysis of the scientific legacy of Professor M. Kabir Hassan was conducted based on his publications from 1991 to 2021. During his long career, he has published 346 journal articles with 23,059 citations and collaborated with 292 authors globally. The findings of conceptual and empirical research papers published by Professor M. Kabir Hassan are crucial for the theoretical developments of Islamic finance, as well as its practical developments as a distinctive discipline. We have derived several research areas for future research based on the research works published by Professor M. Kabir Hassan, as follows: i) the issue of Islamic common market that needs to be examined further in the light of new data and changing global perspectives; ii) a study on the issues faced by Islamic banks in adopting Basel III and capital adequacy framework for Islamic banks; iii) new models for takaful need to be explored; iv) the cost of faith-based investing needs to be studied in the recent times, especially to understand the impact of the pandemic on it; v) a study to understand the perception of the government of Bangladesh, and international and multilateral organisations on the role of zakat to alleviate poverty; vi) the level of technology adoption by Islamic banks can be studied; and vii) the successful implementation of equity-based Islamic finance contracts could be empirically studied.. It is anticipated that this research will motivate young and emerging scholars, as well as existing scholars, to excel in their arenas by producing quality research and publications in a consistent manner. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

At the same time, it does not preclude the use of modern tools and techniques in raising the state revenues. Islam provides its own comprehensive approach how the state can raise its revenue and how the revenue should be spend. Zakat is collected from those who are qualified and distributed to the eight recipients as identified in the Quran. Waqf instrument plays an important role in Muslim societies as its support the aged, the poor, the orphans through provision of education, training and business activities. The creation of waqf is strongly advocated, especially the creation of cash waqf in view of the expensiveness of land as waqf. There are collaboration efforts for cash waqf and zakat collection being done through Islamic banks and takaful. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The data were source from the inland revenue, government agencies and state religious authorities, interviews, articles and conference reviews, as well as economic reports and later transcribe into charts and figures. Findings: Its shows the efficiency of wealth distribution according to the Islamic principles and application of the financial inclusion in the Islamic society.

The article is based on the doctrinal legal research with sociological approach. The data is collected through interview, documentation, and observation by analyzing the data in inductive, deductive, and comparative ways. The result reveals that zakat management in Baznas Pekanbaru is not effective yet in its effort to improve mustahiq (zakat receivers) economy. Of all effective strategies to collect the funds are: 1) government total intervention in collecting and distributing the zakat funds, 2) socialization to the community to pay zakat via Baznas, 3) Improving Baznas’ human resources and management, 4) Implementing the expansion concept in zakat obligation. Meanwhile, the effective strategy in zakat funds distribution is classifying mustahiq into two groups i.e. mustahiq jabariah and mustahiq khiyariah with different model approach. © 2020, Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a constructive method that used the 3 C (communication, coordination and cooperation) model to develop a framework. This included initial assessment of the current usage of ICT in zakat management and the expectation of collaborative zakat management through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. A focus group discussion was conducted to validate the model. Findings: ICT is currently used for the administration of zakat management, providing zakat online services and reporting zakat to the public; ICT is not used for collaboration. The proposed collaboration using the 3 C model consists of communication, coordination and cooperation. The focus group discussion validates the proposed ICT-based collaboration framework as an effective strategy for increasing zakat management. Practical implications: The results highlight strengthening institutional capacity and decreasing overlaps in zakat collection, distribution and empowerment. Zakat institutions need to restructure and reconstruct business processes based on ICT collaboration, and government must provide regulations and ICT infrastructure. Social implications: The results increase equity and capacity in zakat distribution and empowerment, therefore it can improve poverty alleviation.

	abstract = {Recently, the importance of waqf (endowment) has emerged with increasing global interest in sustainable development. The revival of cash waqf as one of the most important types of waqf, as well as the advent of new uses, have resulted in the formation of new Fiqh (juristic) difficulties. This is due to the flexibility and efficiency of cash waqf in mobilizing financial resources for Islamic countries' economic and social development programs. This paper discusses the importance of the juristic issues arising from waqf sukuk (bonds). These issues are zakat, rahn (collateral), and the exchange of waqf sukuk. The paper concludes that zakat is not obligatory on permanent and temporary waqf sukuk, neither on the waqf founder (sukuk holder) nor on the beneficiaries. A distinction is made between debt and qard in regard to the obligation of zakat on the creditor in debt but not in qard. The exchange of sukuk sukuk is discussed in light of juristic disagreement in replacing the waqf asset, adopting permissibility within the Shariah guidelines and precautions. Finally, this paper adopts the impossibility of using waqf sukuk as collateral by the sukuk holder in order to safeguard the waqf asset. This study, on the other hand, waqf sukuk accepts the permissibility in analogy to the permissibility of mortgaging the debt for the benefit of a third party other than the debtor, by using the temporary waqf sukuk as collateral by the sukuk holder. © 2021 Darulfunun Ilahiyat.

This study aims to determine the distribution model and use of productive zakat and to determine the effectiveness of productive zakat in improving welfare after natural disasters in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative methods with the theoretical development of field research. Data collection was carried out through interviews and in-depth observations from national zakat management organizations in Indonesia, including The National Board of Zakat of Republic Indonesia (BAZNAS), The Department of Amil Zakat, Infaq and Alms of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU-Care LAZISNU) The Department of Amil Zakat, Infaq and Alms Muhammadiyah (LAZISMU), as well as communities receiving productive zakat programs. The results of this study indicate that the model of productive zakat distribution by zakat institutions in Indonesia uses two approaches, namely through direct business capital assistance and through proposals addressed to victims of natural disasters. They use zakat for starting businesses or developing businesses that are already owned by the recipient of productive zakat funds. In sum, productive zakat helps the economy of people who receive productive zakat recipients but it is still not effective for their welfare. Therefore, to increase the maximum role of zakat institutions in distributing productive zakat, synergies are needed between zakat institutions, partners (universities, volunteers, business consultants, etc.), and Islamic insurance. © 2021 The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses Istisna’a as a tool of MP and examines its effects on key macroeconomic variables on purely theoretical ground. The effectiveness and the impact of Istisna’a-based MP is examined by using aggregate output and aggregate expenditure model, embedded with Islamic economic principles, including zakat function. Findings: Istisna’a-based MP immediately creates well paid jobs, positively contributes and expands the size of the manufacturing sector, increases capital per person employed, labor productivity and thus increases output, employment and promotes industrialization. Increase in the size of manufacturing sector will not only increase manufactured value-added exports but also cut high valued manufactured imports and thus increases positive trade balance and eventually reduces trade deficits. Increase in labor productivity will improve the standard of living, and eventually the economy will yield sustainable high growth rates, full employment and prosperity. Originality/value: This is probably one of the first attempt to systematically develop the Istisna’a-based MP with detailed MP transmission mechanism. This new contribution in the field of Islamic MP will unveil the horizon of sustainable economic growth, creation of well paid jobs, expansion of manufacturing sector, rapid industrialization and the increase in capital per person employed across the economy, and eventually Istisna’a-based MP will be one of the most effective tool of MP for transforming an economy into a relatively higher and sophisticated stages which will eventually promote sustainable development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

These hospitals have managed to incorporate and integrate waqf with the public goods such as to provide good healthcare services to the Muslim Ummah in their era. This study however, have not found in-depth investigation of past waqf hospitals and documentations to show how their significance, standards and criteria which have managed to successfully evolve and integrate the Islamic culture with the changing of civilization through time. This study examines the macro-level theory pertaining to past waqf-based hospitals in the 8t h-14t h CE, and applies the grounded theory approach, analysis from the historical-comparative (H-C) and triangulation (Neuman 2014) from a qualitative perspective. In determining the themes and detecting important critical terms crucial for this study, open coding was performed on the data collected using the application NVivo 12. The general finding shows that the exclusive elements of the guiding principles of Nour, architectural and urbanism features, decentralization, al-Mizan, governance of the Mutawalli and the financial sustainability found, exist in tandem as fundamental elements for the criteria of past waqf-based hospitals whilst defining each other in their own representations. This study suggests that, the application of the medieval/classical epistemology should be a basis for a current and future developments especially in the application of waqf with a public service organization, healthcare services in particular. © 2020 Islamic Cultural Centre.

Design/methodology/approach: The discussion in this paper is based on secondary sources such as the divine knowledge contained in the Qur’an, Hadiths and the existing literature, such as previously conducted empirical studies and Islamic world view (Tawhidi epistemology). Findings: This paper implores Islamic societies to use Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan as instruments that encourages wealth redistribution that promotes efficient and effective wealth redistribution between haves and have-nots as part of the vicegerent (khaliphah) role between mortal being (human) and his immortal creator (Allah). This paper concludes by suggesting the use of these Islamic financial instruments as means to enhance socio-economic justice and financial inclusion in the Nigeria’s Muslims’ communities that are negatively affected by the high rate of financial exclusion and poverty as had been previously practiced in the Muslim world throughout the Islamic history. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides critical suggestions on the ways Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan will contribute significantly towards assisting Nigeria in achieving its vision of reducing the financial exclusion rate that is currently put at 41.6% to 20% by the year 2020 and may foster inclusive growth and sustainable development. However, the limitation is that it is a mare conceptual study, and the future researchers may subject it to the scientific test to offer empirical evidence regarding the roles of Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan towards closing the gap of financial exclusion in Nigeria.

Interestingly, the enforcement of zakat law was found to significantly influence intention but in a negative direction. Practical implications: Accordingly, it was recommended for policymakers to pay more attention to policy formulation to the identified factors in line with the results so that zakat collection could be increased.

However, whether zakat is effective in improving indicators of both quantity and quality of poverty is still a question requiring empirical investigation. This study is aims to empirically investigate the role of impactful zakat in poverty alleviation as indicated by the BAZNAS prosperity index (Indeks Kesejahteraan BAZNAS or IKB), at provincial level in Indonesia. This study covers annual data from 28 provinces in Indonesia for the years 2017 and 2018. Data analysis uses a panel-data approach, with three indicators of poverty – the poverty headcount ratio (P0), poverty gap index (P1), and poverty severity index (P2) – as dependent variables. The study finds that higher BAZNAS IKB, used as a sign of impactful zakat, significantly reduces P0 but has insignificant effect on P1 and P2. The results of this study imply that zakat managers should put emphasis on the poorest section of the poor population to enable improvements in poverty indicators through zakat utilization. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

In spite of its remarkable significance, microfinance still faces some obstacles in the industry. A significant challenge is its poor performance in terms of business growth due to lack of integrative approaches and creative resources.

However, the element of urgency as an intangible resource is needed to ensure the collaboration practice will perform well and significantly contribute towards sustainable socioeconomic growth. Thus, this study aims to examine the impact of urgency on the performance of Waqf-Microfinance project collaborations. To contextualize sustainability within the collaborative practice, this study has evaluated the mediating influence of sustainability in terms of the relationship between urgency and the performance of Waqf-Microfinance collaborative projects. Subsequently, the advance partial least square technique (PLS) was employed as the primary approach to assessing the research model of the study. A quantitative approach was employed in this study.

This study focused on three forms of philanthropic zakat assistance: economic empowerment, health care, and tuition-free education. There were 21 participants—seven from each respective cluster. Interviewers were employed to elicit participants’ perspectives. Major findings showed economic empowerment recipients were the poor affected by the earthquake and the monetary crisis. Zakat helped them re-open their businesses. As they grew, most felt satisfied and employed jobless individuals. Recipients of health care with elementary education had a five-year grant of free health care and health education. Although the service lowered their expenses, some needed extra help with food. Participants benefitting from either program reported positive impacts on their income, health, and social lives. Most participants in the tuition-free education were satisfied with their children's schooling, the extracurricular options, and the chances for parental involvement in the social engagement. Some stated the charitable schools emphasized moral education over science; thus, they were concerned about sufficient preparation for future competitive educational levels. Recipients would benefit from the charities if three programs were altogether offered. This study suggests the integrative community development programs should be reviewed for better services. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

	abstract = {The quality of human resources is one of the supporting factors to improve the progress and sustainability of an organization or company. Work culture is one indicator of the good and bad quality of human resources. Therefore, it is important to apply a work culture to every existing human resource. Rumah Zakat is one of the largest socials (non-profit) organizations in Indonesia that has implemented a work culture transformation that has been implemented since 2017. Because of the importance of transforming work culture at Rumah Zakat, it is necessary to evaluate the implementation of work culture. However, the evaluation is still not maximally carried out in implementing the application of work culture with the 360 Degree Feedback assessment concept because there is no system or application that can support the implementation of the assessment of the application of work culture in real time (online) and can directly process the data of the assessment results and provide decision results from the implementation of the application. work culture. Therefore, an application or decision support system for evaluating the application of employee work culture at Rumah Zakat was built using a web-based Multifactor Evaluation Process (MFEP) method to facilitate the process of evaluating the application of employee work culture objectively with the concept of 360 Degree Feedback based on weights and assessment indicators that have been assessed. determined based on each employee rank. The results of the data presented in the application show that in semester 1 of 2019 out of 459 respondents, 68.4% were above the standard and 22% met the standard. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Equal wealth distribution is a very important economical aspect of a society. If wealth is being circulated throughout society in a well-managed way, it can eliminate many social problems such as poverty, criminal activities, child labor etc. Thus, effective wealth circulation is one of the major building blocks that helps in forming a progressive as well as flourishing society. One of the pertinent research questions in this regard is how wealth circulation can be automated keeping societal dynamics in account. If state of different societies is examined, wealth distribution is getting wicked, as poor are getting poorer over time. As these dynamics affect population at large, hence it is not feasible to experiment social reforms directly in real life. Therefore, in this study an agent-based computational model is proposed. This model could be simulated to conduct different experiments and test various social intervention to understand and solve this problem in detail. In the light of existing literature, there exist several models to address the issue of wealth circulation. Keeping the cultural and religious aspects of a Muslim society in view, in this study, the concepts of inheritance and Zakat are being incorporated in an existing wealth distribution model. In addition to that, proposed model is capable to provide solution for the betterment of wealth circulation in a society. After several simulations it is evident that Zakat and national Zakat treasury centers play a vital role in eradication of improper wealth distribution that is currently prevailing in several societies. In addition to that, awareness among masses regarding the treasury centers can also significantly impact the societal dynamics. Thus, the proposed model can be highly significant for deprived societies where poor class is swelling rapidly.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Waqf (Islamic endowment) is considered one of the alternative solutions to environmental problems in Indonesia. One of the examples is through the establishment of a waqf forest, a conservation initiative in the form of developing forests on waqf land. The development of waqf forests needs to pay attention to the legal side in accordance with the laws and regulations of Indonesia. Previous studies discussed the process of legalizing waqf land in Indonesia, but research about the legalization of waqf forest land is still scarce. This study aims to determine the process of legalizing waqf forests on the basis of Indonesian laws and regulations. On the basis of the results of literature studies and expert interviews that were analyzed descriptively, the process of legalizing waqf forest is one of the main tasks of a nazir (waqf manager). The process involves at least three government agencies: the Ministry of Religion, the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning (National Land Agency), and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The waqf forest legalization process begins with making a waqf pledge deed at the local Office of Religious Affairs, followed by creating a waqf land certificate at the local Land Offices. A crucial step is to clarify that the represented land must be located outside the forest area through a statement from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The legalization of waqf forests will guarantee the sustainability of the forest because this process makes waqf forest legal under Islamic law and the law of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, University of Indonesia Faculty of Law.

Implicit in the entire transfer system was personal property rights as well as constraints on government—two key elements of a liberal order. Those features could have provided the starting point for broadening political liberties under a state with explicitly restricted functions. Instead, just a few decades after the rise of Islam, zakat opened the door to arbitrary political rule and material insecurity. A major reason is that the Quran does not make explicit the underlying principles of governance. It simply outlines the specifics of zakat as they related to conditions in seventh-century Arabia. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In a community in Indonesia, the proposal of establishing a mosque as the activity center has increasingly bloomed. This program restores the exuberance of the mosque through religious practices and places it as the center of community life in social, cultural, and economic aspects. In Palangka Raya, several mosques played an economic role in building bazaars around mosques, including bistros and other small businesses. Given that most of the mosques in the city have obtained large amounts of infaq (almsgiving) and waqf, it is essential to know the extent to which these funds are used in improving the economy of Muslims, especially in Palangka Raya and its surrounding area. The researchers used qualitative research by extracting primary data through interviews, observations, and documentation. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of empowerment of infaq and waqf in the mosques of Palangka Raya City in the maqasid al-sharia perspective. This study argued that the problems in the economic empowerment plan for mosques in Palangka Raya were the lack of human resources (HR), socialization, and funds. Therefore, to minimize the drawbacks, mosque management should continue to improve its quality by socializing mosque programs, providing training for new mosque cadres, and offering professional development for existing human resources on managing zakat, infaq, and sadaqah to maximize the mosque income. © 2021 Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry.

We are aware that conventional microfinance products have flourished in India; however, these products do not fulfil the needs of all Muslim clients. Taking small glimpses of Islamic microfinance (IMF), we can say it is working successfully in Muslim countries. From the meta-analysis we classify the literature into seven categories, viz. social benefits, religious values, business enterprises, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, rural development and economic development. The contribution of research papers has risen across the literature review and there has been a sharp rise in new facts pertaining to Islamic microfinance in India. As a diagnostic check, all seven factors of the meta-analysis of IMF contain evidence for the case study of India. Bait-un-Nasr is an urban co-operative credit society, located in Mumbai, India that has practised all of the factors extracted by the meta-analysis. This paper provides a roster of emerging projects accompanied by a comprehensive review of literature that will be useful to both academicians and practitioners for studying existing research and contemporary future research. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Islamic MFIs, which follow Shariah principles in their operations, aim not only to provide financing, but also to improve the socioeconomic conditions of poor people. There is heightened interest in the factors influencing the development of MFIs, such as relationship lending. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of such lending and the uniqueness of the implementation of social purpose in Islamic MFIs. The paper adopts a quantitative methodology, using cross-sectional survey data from 1,001 microloan borrowers from five MFIs, three of which are Islamic MFIs which provided financing in 13 regions in Indonesia in 2018. The results show that Islamic MFIs do not differ in the implementation of relationship lending. Furthermore, there is a likelihood that they are able to be more focused on profit-oriented transactions ensuring sustainability, due to their unique characteristics, as they have Baitul Maal with the social instruments of zakat, infaq and sadaqa to provide social-oriented transactions to improve outreach to the poor. The study enhances our understanding and adds knowledge to the existing literature on Islamic MFIs, especially in Indonesia. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Islamic micro-finance, despite being a small part of the Islamic finance industry, plays a significant role in poverty alleviation and financial inclusion activities. One of the key challenges facing Islamic micro-finance institutions (IMFIs) is the lack of measures of performance, which hinders the process of evaluating IMFIs’ performance and the dynamic growth of the micro-financing sector. Unlike the conventional financial sector, there have been few attempts to measure the performance of IMFIs. The knowledge of measures and determinants of success factors for IMFIs is limited and compounded by a lack of theoretical basis underpinning research in this area. This paper focuses on examining the performance measures of micro-financing institutions in Islamic micro-financing. The determination of IMFI success factors would assist in the external evaluation and internal improvements of IMFIs, which would contribute to a more dynamic micro-finance industry. Therefore, IMFIs should be evaluated not only on output and the outcome measures of both social and financial performance, but also the process and with a view of the entire value chain of financing, along with the internal process of fostering borrower cooperation to enable the achievement of well-being. © 2020.

	abstract = {Waqf company is a new concept in the waqf. It is different from the conventional waqf that is based on real estate and plantations. It is also different from the cash waqf. Due to this, the purpose of this paper is to study the concept of waqf company, try to define it, and establish how it works through the use of the Saudi Arabian practice as a reference point. This research adopted a qualitative research method, using content analysis of the secondary literature from both classical and contemporary jurists and legal experts’ opinions. Some of the major findings are the definition of a waqf company whose shares are all waqf. It also found that a company does not become a waqf company because of having few shares declared as waqf by their owners. In terms of incorporation, waqf company can take any form of business entity that could be used as a vehicle for commercial activities. The limitation of the research is that there is little literature because the topic is still new. The research presents a practicable concept of the waqf company. To prove this, there is a need to establish a business entity so that the assets and the shares are declared as waqf so that the dividends will be benefiting the designated beneficiaries. The research has a social implication, considering waqf as an Islamic social fund. It will help policymakers further push for adequate laws and regulations that will strengthen the operationality and efficiency of waqf company, thereby significantly reducing poverty and creating jobs through employment by the waqf company.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of owner family involvement in business on sustainable survival of family small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and to empirically validate the intervening role of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze data from 489 owner and nonowner executives of 150 family SMEs using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling). Findings: The authors found evidence that family involvement in business positively impacts the sustainable survival of family SMEs while corporate social responsibility partially mediates this relationship. Apart from effective family involvement in business, active involvement in social causes enhances a firm's ability to survive longer. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted in a geographic context and data were collected from family-managed and controlled firms. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to all types of family firms in the global context. In an Islamic society, family firms need to invest in social causes, human development, and environmental sustainability through zakat, sadaqat, and donations. Practical implications: The findings imply that family firms require stakeholder-centric competitive strategies and socially responsible behavior along with effective family control, commitment, enrichment, and successful succession since the path to sustainable survival goes through CSR. Originality/value: Survival is the biggest challenge facing family SMEs forcing them to achieve the ability to sustain longer. Rooted in transaction cost economics (TCE) theory of the family firm and stakeholder theory, this paper validates an integrative model for family SMEs' sustainable survival. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The core principles of Islamic finance align highly with the sustainable development goals, especially Zakat and awqaf and Sukuk, which profoundly support SDGs. Islamic finance is considered a viable source to fill the funding gap in achieving SDGs through social micro-financing. Green Sukuk and other similar innovative Islamic products that alleviate SDG achievement are gaining global attention. In this paper, we have presented an overview of the Islamic perspectives on SDGs, the interrelationship between Islamic finance and SDGs, and how Islamic finance can promote achieving SDGs in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Although the community economic development program has been implemented, the assistance model provided so far has not been able to provide increased income for the community. This article responds to the view that Baitul Mal in carrying out its programs is only consumptive in nature and has not been able to develop productive programs related to the community's economy by providing venture capital for home industry players. This qualitative research in finding a model of Baitul Mal assistance was done through observation, interviews, and documentation. The data obtained is used to strengthen the research objectives in supporting the assistance model for the assistance of Baitul Mal Aceh. This study found that the Baitul Mal Aceh program was more dominant in the field of consumptive zakat, while the assistance model of Baitul Mal assistance in the form of productive zakat had not been able to provide maximum results for the economic development of the community, especially in the home industry sector. So in the future, there needs to be an improvement, as an initial solution in introducing the Baitul Mal Aceh assistance model to the community.  © 2020 Sabirin et al.},

Specifically, this study intends to measure the differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat and measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The response to these issues, the study estimates the value of the Human Development Index (HDI) at a minor level; the individual and household levels. 100 recipients of zakat (mustahik) from the three programs of zakat distribution by the zakat institution of Aceh Province, Indonesia (Baitul Mal Aceh - BMA) were selected as the sample of the study using a combination of purposive and proportionate stratified random samplings. These zakat programs include zakat for cancer and thalassemia patients, zakat for one family one undergraduate scholarship, and zakat for buying working capital for the poor families. The paired t-test is adopted to assess the differences in HDI of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat, while the multiple linear regression is used to measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The study found that, after receiving zakat, the HDI of zakat recipients is higher than before. Zakat is also recorded to have a significant positive effect on the HDI, while the family size affected negatively the HDI and the types of zakat and profession of zakat recipients have an insignificant effect on the HDI. These findings suggest the positive role of zakat in improving human development and it could be used as one of the instruments to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs agenda in Indonesia. © 2020 Hellenic Association of Regional Scientists.

This research adopts the qualitative approach which employing in-depth interviews at seven (7) CWP as a case study that covered the state of Johor, Selangor, Penang and WPKL. Semistructured interviews were conducted with six (6) waqf property managers (WPM) and twenty-one (21) tenants to get their perspective regarding the issues of tenancy management according to TM attributes. From the findings, it was found that the tenancy businesses attribute is the most issues voiced by the tenants and WPMs followed by tenancy agreement, rental determination and enforcement. Meanwhile, tenant selection and waqf property manager attributes are less critical. Hence, the solutions have been proposed to improve the sustainability of CWP while Shariah principles and waqf needs are being adhered to in the full spectrum of waqf tenancy management. © 2021 Malaysian Institute Of Planners.

Despite women being crucial clients, none of the studied BMTs explicitly invoked women’s empowerment in their organizational vision.

Findings: The study reveals that IMFS have led to structural transformation in the occupation dynamics of the respondents’ families from agriculture to retail businesses. IMFS have had a significant positive impact on household income, savings and expenditure; have improved standard of living and human capital formation; and have enhanced all three dimensions of empowerment, namely, economic empowerment (ECEM), socio-cultural empowerment (SCEM) and familial empowerment (FLEM). Of them, ECEM and SCEM have positively contributed toward overall women’s empowerment, while FLEM has a negative but insignificant impact on overall empowerment. The respondents’ perception also supports the finding that IMFS have benefited rural women and empowered them. Originality/value: The study is based on primary data.

A qualitative method with a case study approach was employed. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, observations and documentation techniques and then inductively analyzed. The results show that Suryakarta Beramal is a philanthropy institution ideologically affiliated with the Tarbiyah movement. Most of the collected Islamic philanthropy funds zakat, (alms-giving), infaq, sadaqah (donation), and wakaf (religious endowment) were provided to finance the educational institution possessed by Suryakarta Beramal, except for poverty alleviation. The educational institution also functions as an ideologization medium. Ideologization was conducted through curriculum engineering, holding various events such as smart recharging, liqa’, mabit, rihlah and halaqah and students’ habituation, starting from using uniforms for religious activities either at school or in the dormitory. The result of the ideologization is that the alumni of the school of Suryakarta Beramal became the loyalists of the Tarbiyah ideology and are affiliated with Partai Adil Makmur (PAM) (Just and Affluent Party) as the political wing of the Tarbiyah movement in Indonesia. Penelitian ini mengkaji praktik ideologisasi lembaga filantropi Islam yang dikelola oleh masyarakat sipil di Indonesia — studi kasus Yayasan Suryakarta Beramal. Metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan studi kasus digunakan. Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan wawancara mendalam, observasi dan teknik dokumentasi kemudian dianalisis secara induktif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Suryakarta Beramal merupakan lembaga filantropi yang secara ideologis berafiliasi dengan gerakan Tarbiyah. Sebagian besar dana zakat, sedekah, infaq, sadaqah (sedekah), dan wakaf (wakaf) yang terkumpul sebagian besar digunakan untuk membiayai lembaga pendidikan yang dimiliki oleh Suryakarta Beramal, kecuali untuk pengentasan kemiskinan. Institusi pendidikan juga berfungsi sebagai media ideologisasi. Ideologisasi dilakukan melalui rekayasa kurikulum dengan mengadakan berbagai acara seperti smart recharging, liqa ’, mabit, rihlah dan alaqah serta pembiasaan siswa, mulai dari penggunaan seragam untuk kegiatan keagamaan baik di sekolah maupun di asrama. Akibat dari ideologisasi tersebut adalah alumni sekolah Suryakarta Beramal menjadi loyalis ideologi Tarbiyah dan berafiliasi dengan Partai Adil Makmur (PAM) sebagai sayap politik gerakan Tarbiyah di Indonesia. © 2020.

	abstract = {In many countries, one strategy has emerged to resolve the challenges for improving access to credit facilities by creating a microfinance institution (MFI) that provides credit to low-income families. However, as a Muslim majority country, Indonesia has established a new form of MFI that comply with Shariah's Shariah Microfinance Institution (SMFI). Besides the shariah based product, SMFI has existed in rural areas, including Pesantren is known as Micro Waqf Bank (MWB). It has created to solve the poverty issues among low-income families that live in rural areas. Also, the main goal of MWB is to provide the convenience platform regarded as the business capital and financing to middle-lower income people and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). In line with the vital role of MWB, the present study is written to investigate the effect of MWB sector expansion in reducing the poverty issues among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. This study utilizes the secondary data collected from two sources, i.e. Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and Islamic Microfinance Institutions and Micro Waqf Banks (IMFI - BWM) for 2018 2019. This study found that MWB financing has a significant negative effect on poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. We also found that the number of MWB does not significantly affect poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. On the basis of the study findings, we concluded that MWB plays an important role in reducing poverty among rural communities. In contrast, increase MWB financing institution will be alleviating the poverty among them. Also, the number of MWB has not been fully affected by the number of low-income families in rural areas, Indonesia, due to the small number of operated MWB in Indonesia. © IEOM Society International.},

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of religiosity, religious leader’s endorsement, social influence and income on the intention to apply for Islamic microfinance among Muslims in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on a public survey to collect primary data from various states in Malaysia. Then, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse the data set. Findings: The results of SEM indicate significant roles for religiosity and religious leader’s endorsement as religion-based factors on intention to apply for microfinance products. Moreover, social influence (peer-pressure) is influential on the financial decision-making process. The authors also examined the moderation effect of gender on these relations and found that females, in comparison to males, tend to be more influenced by religious leader’s endorsement and social influence. On the other hand, male with higher religiosity tend to favour Islamic microfinance products more than females. Originality/value: Findings of this study are new in many aspects, most importantly as it sheds light into the role of religiosity and religious leader’s endorsement on the decision-making process in microfinancing services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The research method comes from previous studies to compare the capitalist, socialist, and sharia economic systems. In response to various economic uncertainties, both internal and external, the ability to seize opportunities and transform has become the key to economic resilience. Islamic economics can be an alternative in responding to the dynamics of the global and national economy. Several things need to be taken into consideration in fulfilling the sharia economy and the primary strategy chosen must come from the inputs given by the stakeholders, including business actors, associations, regulators as well as experts, and academicians. The primary strategy in implementing the sharia economy also requires the support of various parties in order to develop sustainability. Strengthening regulation and governance is one of the fundamental factors. Optimization of the sharia economy based social sector such as Zakat, Infaq, Sadaqah, and Waqaf can be optimized both for collection and distribution so that the concept of sharing can certainly support the development and the economy both nationally and globally. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {Islamic microfinance is expanding and penetrating its potential market over the globe. Access to credit or financing, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, is vital for micro-entrepreneurs in climbing the socio-economic ladder that will contemporaneously increase their household income. In Malaysia, most of the MEs can hardly access financing from formal financial institutions due to poor credit rating, having zero to little collateral, income instability, small loan amounts, and high transaction costs. Alternatively, MEs approach Islamic microfinance institutions for their financing solution. Therefore, this study intends to investigate how far the utilization of Islamic microfinancing by MEs could enhance their quality of life. One hundred seven (107) usable questionnaires were analysed via the Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) AMOS using IBM® SPSS and found that both investment and expansion factors played key roles in affecting the financial wellbeing of the micro-entrepreneurs. The results lend credence to the positive effect of Islamic microfinance products may have on MEs and indirectly support the long-term economic development for MEs. This study deliver implication to various angles. In practical part, it opens the eyes of micro-entrepreneurs to opt for the right path (expansion and investment) to achieve financial wellbeing. Government (regulators) can enhance the ability of Islamic microfinancing as a tool towards financial wellbeing and in theoretical part, this study deepens the scope of Schumpeter’s theory by inculcate this theory with Islamic finance scope of study. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

One approach to improving this was the establishment of microfinance, which has since become an important part of poverty alleviation strategies, but very few studies have considered its benefits based on characteristics other than poverty. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and determine how different client characteristics affect the way people benefit from the financing provided by microfinance institutions. Data were gathered from the beneficiaries of both conventional and Islamic microfinance using a questionnaire, and then analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann–Whitney U tests. The results show how MFI financing benefits clients differently based on certain characteristics, as well as how these socioeconomic benefits differ based on whether the financing is provided by a conventional or an Islamic MFI. Overall, conventional and Islamic MFIs have similar strategies when it comes to providing socio-economic benefits to their clients. However, where they diverge is when client gender is considered, as IMFIs are more likely to benefit women. This research will be beneficial to MFIs in terms of the development of their services, as it will help them identify the strengths and weaknesses of their offerings and how well these are able to assist them in fulfilling their purpose of providing benefit to the poorest of the poor, increasing financial inclusion and contributing to socio-economic development. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Islamic MFIs, which adhere to Sharia's prohibition of riba (usually interpreted as a ban on interest), present an alternative. Differences between conventional and Islamic MFIs in terms of outreach and financial sustainability remain underexplored; no comprehensive data set details Islamic MFIs either. With new data, collected with a global survey, the authors construct a unique panel of 543 conventional and 101 Islamic MFIs, operating in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. These data suggest that the market for Islamic microfinance is more important than previously recognized, has grown in recent years, and is likely to continue growing in every region of the world. Statistical comparisons, using various estimation techniques, regarding the outreach and financial performance of Islamic and conventional MFIs also reveal that the breadth and depth of Islamic MFIs exceed those of conventional MFIs, though conventional MFIs achieve stronger financial performance.

	abstract = {This study develops and validates a comprehensive mechanism for evaluating the effect of zakat (obligatory alms-giving) on reducing poverty and attaining some of the prominent Sustainable Development Goals. The study unconventionally analyzes the effect of macrolevel data on microlevel data on district level of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Microlevel data are utilized from a renowned national survey, Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) from which the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been computed, whereas the macrolevel data have been collected from Zakat & Usher Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Based on the nature of nested data set, we have used a multilevel model to counter intra-class correlation. The findings confirmed and validated that the novel aspect of the zakat negatively affects the multidimensional poverty and portray significant contribution in targeting several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Pakistan. Based on the empirical evidence, Zakat being as an obligatory arm which equips individuals to fulfill their necessities, this paper suggests necessary strategies toward zakat disbursement. The mechanism should be refined to stimulate economic growth and pursue SDGs via financial empowerment of less advantaged class of society by reducing poverty in developing countries like Pakistan. Moreover, the methodology adopted in the study opens doors for more enabling and conducive research practices in order to decompose the results and design policies accordingly. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

	abstract = {People with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) commonly pose problems to their family as well as to society because of their vulnerable health and economic conditions. Contrarily, PLWHA encounter social discrimination and adverse realities while finding it difficult to continue in their jobs. These complex phenomena interact to push them into a low economic status. A microfinance program can hopefully assist poor patients to cope with the negative economic consequences of this disease. But the conventional market-oriented microfinance institutions show reluctance to serve this group of people due to the possibilities of having credit risk. In this paper, we propose an alternative microfinancing technique that can provide a better economic life of the PLWHA while absorbing the credit risks. A comprehensive model is designed using specific Islamic financial instruments in conjugation with household economic portfolio theory. Critical realism method was adopted to construct this model. We concluded that the application of Islamic microfinance can enhance income of HIV patients while reducing the productivity-loss. This model can be useful to the microfinance practitioners and policymakers for addressing a different market segment, diversifying products, and formulating policy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

By paying zakat in such a way, muzaki can support zakat institutions in eradicating poverty through a broader and deeper distribution of zakat funds. However, the realisation of zakat collection remains low compared to its potential, which means that the number of muzaki who pay zakat through institutions also remains limited. The research applied the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework with knowledge, trust, and perceived ease of use as additional variables to address the issue in question. Subsequently, an online questionnaire was conducted using the purposive sampling method, which generated 383 respondents. The primary data were examined using the PLS-SEM method. Based on the results, all the proposed hypotheses were accepted. Considering that paying zakat via institutions provides a better way to assist rightful recipients, various suggestions are made to zakat managers, policymakers, and muzaki.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology in this paper is that the data were elicited from secondary sources such as the Al-Qur’an, Hadiths and other empirical studies in the existing literature. The Tawhidi epistemology (Islamic world view) also has been obtained to deliver better understanding on the findings. Findings: The paper implores Islamic societies to take advantages of integrating Waqf to support the financing needs of disadvantaged members of the Muslims communities, especially the Muslims, dominated northern Nigeria with a high level of financial exclusion. The Waqf funds if integrated and institutionalized will support the region by making the fewer privilege members of that community-engaged thereby economically and enhancing the financial inclusion. This will also lead to economic growth and socio-economic development of Nigeria. Practical implications: The paper concludes by suggesting the establishment of Waqf funds to supports the less privileged people through Islamic Microfinance as means of enhancing socio-economic justice in Nigeria’s Muslims’ communities, which is negatively affected by the high rate of financial exclusion and poverty. This paper also provides critical suggestions on the ways the integration of Waqf funds will contribute significantly towards assisting Nigeria in achieving its vision of reducing the financial exclusion rate and may foster inclusive growth and sustainable development. Originality/value: This paper is a conceptual study and, therefore, limited to the content of the existing literature.

Subsequently, it also examines the effect of gender as a moderator in the model. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 381 beneficiaries of PROCAPEC – a major Islamic microfinance provider in Mauritania. In methodology, the study uses confirmatory factor analysis to identify relevant involuntary factors affecting usage, followed by structural equation modelling to test the impact of these factors on the usage of Islamic microfinance (IsMF) products. Findings: Two of the four factors are statistically significant in affecting the usage of IsMF products, namely, affordability and eligibility. Gender is a moderator in the relationship between affordability and usage, as well as eligibility and usage. Practical implications: Policymakers, practitioners and managers of Islamic microfinance institutions can consider these factors and focus on strategies, including pricing and promotion, which aim to further develop the Islamic microfinance industry in Mauritania. Also, reducing documentation required from clients and adopting lenient rules to provide suitable products will enhance the use of IsMF products, which may lead to more customers’ attraction. Originality/value: Although several researchers have articulated financial inclusion, this study sheds light on a specific dimension of financial inclusion to determine the factors impacting IsMF products’ usage.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to reveal the function of the concept of Infāq, which is included in the terminology of the Qurʾān itself, in social assistance and solidarity. Poverty has always been one of the social problems from past to present. Although it is analyzed dif-ferently in each society via different criteria, poverty generally refers to the condition in which a person lacks the basic necessities for a minimum living standard. Unfortunately, mil-lions of people starve for basic biological and social needs such as nutrition, shelter, educa-tion, health, and even water. This is a shame for the humanity. There are both international and national charities working to reduce the misery and poverty. However, due to socio-eco-nomic and structural problems such as globalization, disproportion in income distribution, unemployment, overpopulation, economic crises, lack of social security systems, and wars, poverty rises gradually and it is still one of the major social problems needed to be solved. Islam which is the last one of Abrahamic religions and its holy book Qurʾān consider social cooperation and solidarity pretty important within the context of Infāq and hold the believers responsible for the organization of social life. Infāq is an umbrella concept in the Qurʾān, re-ferring to all expenses and cooperation in the name of Allah and it is one of the main qualities of believers. Infāq, which includes other forms of cooperation such as obligatoryalms (zakāt) and charity (ṣadaqā), enables a person to share his tangible values with those who have worse life conditions than himself. In this way, the Quran aims to promote human relations and thereby enhancement and peace in the society. In other words, Infāq aims to eliminate social injustice which refers to social and economic inequalities, to protect the economically weak people against the difficulties in life, and thereby, to maintain economic and social stability. Helping the needy is a powerful path toward having spiritual peace, removing selfish feelings, and keeping emotional wellbeing. People with good mental health will be able to build more humane relationships with others. It is obvious that Infāq would play an important role in-building a sense of fellowship and trust. A wealth of person who shares his wealth with the poor will be deemed legitimate by the needy people. Thus, the needy people would be freed from negative feelings and behaviors such as jealousy, incapacity, hatred, bullying, and hos-tility, and feel a sense of fellowship and gratitude towards those who have better life condi-tions. One of the most important reasons for robbery, extortion, purse-snatching, and etc., which are currently occurring more frequently, is economic deprivation. Considering the fact that this kind of incidents takes place more frequently in poor countries than developed ones, it is obvious that Infāq has a strategic role in fulfilling the basic needs of the needy. Poverty might be linked to violence, which might end up with murder. Infāq which is divine coopera-tion approach would take an important role in fighting against criminal incidents that cause fear and indignation. Moreover, the Quran does not specify any certain economic condition to be able to do Infāq, and thereby, it makes people with various economic abilities become a part of the social cooperation. As everyone would take care of people who are relatively worse off, interindividual trust will be strengthen and circle of cooperation will be expanded. Ac-cording to the Qurʾān, people’s all goods and possessions actually belong to Allah. People are just the trustees of this wealth. Allah grants as much wealth as He wills to whomever He wills. While the rich is responsible for sharing their wealth with the needy, the poor is responsible for bearing the troubles caused by poverty with patience and endeavoring to make money in a halal way. Unless Infāq is done in order to please Allah, it does not have any significance in the presence of Allah. The reason why people have different material living conditions is that both the poor and the rich are subject to test. Thus, they would get rewards for hereafter besides the sustaining of social unity and solidarity. Allah is the only warrantor of the tangible and spiritual wealth gained in return for Infāq.

	abstract = {Financial institutions in transition economies maintain higher liquidity at the cost of economic growth. This study offers an alternative policy tool to achieve higher liquidity without compromising economic growth. We show that Zakat—an obligatory Islamic charity with a fixed rate of 2.5%—can be an alternative to the interest rate and that its use as a policy tool promotes economic growth. Instead of considering zakat as a fiscal tool—an alternative to tax—we present it as a monetary policy tool to substitute the interest rate. We provide a framework based on the endogenous growth model, which allows the use of Zakat as a tool to overcome liquidity constraints in transition economies. We also construct an index-based varying zakat rate adjusted for economic fundamentals, such as economic growth, for each economy. We provide empirical evidence using system generalized method of moments (GMM) in a simultaneous equation model on a panel data of 38 countries for the period 1996–2015. The results show that zakat rate has a significantly positive impact on economic growth. Furthermore, as a policy tool, Zakat has a statistically significant positive impact on FDI and domestic investment, while reducing corruption (CR). The results are robust for various regions and income classifications in different transition economies. The overall findings corroborate that zakat can help achieve the dual objectives of enhanced liquidity and higher levels of economic growth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The problem of poverty in the Muslim world has been posing multi-faceted challenges to the life of individuals and the relations of people. Although this problem has been gaining scholarly attention and raised in relation to various issues ranging from social injustice, rampant corruption, societal instability, wide social polarization and insurgent movements that affect the regional peace and stability at large, neither effective economic mechanism proposed nor implemented to address the problem effectively. In this regard, it is also important to appreciate the recent initiations in the field of Islamic economics to present an optional view to the existing and alien economic models in the Muslim world. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to fill up this research gap by proposing a model of mobilizing funds through the global cash-waqf institution. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts content analysis to construct this global cash waqf model for poverty alleviation in Muslim countries. Findings: The “global cash-waqf model” was proposed as an alternative that could be implemented and used to overcome the poverty matter in Muslim countries. It is assumed that the model will facilitate the fund mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return is going to assure full distribution and redistribution of wealth to eradicate the poverty in the Muslim world. The model was structured with a global vision in both the collection side and the distribution side. Originality/value: The model will facilitate the fund’s mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return achieves an Islamic goal of distribution and redistribution of wealth to assure the well-being of all humanities in the society. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, this paper proposes the Conceptual Framework of Sustainable Tahfiz Model (STM), which integrates three main scopes, i.e., Rainwater Harvesting System (RWHS), Renewable Energy Strategies (RES) and Food Subsistence Strategies (FSS). The nexus of such a green approach requires an ecological footprint in producing and consuming food through a series of connections between energy and clean water. Evidently, this is an alternative in maximizing existing resources and at the same time to generate extra income for PTIs in Malaysia to improve their sustainability.

In methodology, a total of 34 managers of Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMTs) were taken as respondents from the Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi (JABODETABEK) areas. A two-step approach was adopted in arriving at enriching findings: first, a survey questionnaire was distributed to the respondents, and subsequently, an in-depth interview was conducted to outline data related to the model design. The findings of this study highlight specific dimensions to improve financial inclusion among the poor. Apart from providing important inputs for better decision-making for the BMTs to further enhance its role in poverty alleviation, this study suggests a variety of strategies to warrant success of poverty alleviation efforts by BMT. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

A Tawhidic concept premised on the Quran and Sunnah was used to underpin the development of the proposed corporate waqf model. Content analyses of existing academic literature on Waqf, followed by preliminary semi-structured interviews on groups of Chief Executive Officers, SIRC officers, Islamic Scholars and Academics, were conducted. The key challenges faced by waqf organisations are as follows: i) the development of waqf properties is not economical; and ii) the current waqf model does not support the wealth creation, wealth enhancement and wealth distribution to the ummah. These weaknesses have motivated this study to propose a new corporate waqf model; one that encompasses an enhanced governance structure and management setting. This new model treats waqf as an effective mechanism that can strengthen the economic growth of Malaysia. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

A qualitative method is used in analysing and synthesizing the relevant literature and document review to develop this model from the framework of Maqasid Shariah, together with the combination of accelerating rapid growth of the world technologies and digitalization. This theoretical study examines the Quranic verses and theories from scholars to support this model. The aspect of education will also be zoomed in to ensure that this model is developed systematically and professionally. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

However, provision of access and services to lower-level households can potentially conflict with the sustainability of the institutions. This study analyses the social outreach factors that determine financial and social efficiencies. To reach the set goal and solve this issue, we used mixed methodology combining quantitative (statistical instruments, such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and multivariate analysis) and qualitative approaches (interviews to clarify or deepen the existing information). The assessment of the dependent variables is influenced by proxies of depth, breadth, length, scope, and cost. The results showed that the average loan instalments and the number of offices and branches significantly influence financial and social efficiency. The age of the institution only has an effect on financial efficiency. Simultaneously, profit orientation, the amount and type of financing and the amount and type of savings only have a high impact on social efficiency, whereas the impact of fund collection and cost per borrower is insignificant. There is a strong positive correlation between the two dependent variables. The influence of independent variables on financial and social efficiency is significant with the coefficient of determination 23.1274 % and 53.2941 %, respectively. © 2020 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The existance of nashir is also one of the uniqueness of another form of management of Islamic Philantropic funds, namely zakat. Nazhir‘s role is to manage and empower waqf objects so that the existance of waqf objects can provide and bring benefits in a sustainable manner of the benefit of the general public (ummah). The results of the development of waqf that are managed professionally and by Nazhir who is trustworthy (amanah) and professional, and by the BWI Institute wil l bring benefits and for the public, both in the form of designating a development of mosque / musholla facilities, Islamic educational institutions, Islamic hospital development, or for the benefit of other people's economic empowerment assistance. This paper provides an overview of how the concept of the mandatory sector is seen in the formation and appointment of Nazhir Legal Entities in terms of managing waqf assets. The Voluntary sector is inherent in the basic principles of the practice of waqf. So the authors assume that a waqf asset that is managed by using the principle of 'mandatory', will have an impact and a large contribution to sustain the economy of the community. As is well known, there are quite a number of social institutions that sustainably show a large contribution to improving the welfare of the community, and this is sourced from and by endowment funds which are voluntarily submitted from the endowment. The forming of Regulation Number 28 of 2004 concerning Amendments to Regulation Number 16 of 2001 concerning Foundations is i n tended to better ensure legal certainty and legal order, as well as provide a correct understanding to the public regarding the Foundation, so that it can restore the function of the Foundation as a legal institution in order to achieve certain objectives in the field of social, religious and humanitarian.

	abstract = {Sustainable development of waqf (Endowment) property is the mutawalli's responsibility to make the waqf property productive and can produce benefits that can enhance or increase the value of the waqf properties. The development that not only contributes to welfare but also to finance or income is considered as one of the forms of sustainable development. This proves that sustainable development of waqf property can contribute to the socio-economic development of Muslims. However, how far is the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf can be comprehended appropriately? What are the characteristics of sustainable waqf property development? How can the concept of sustainability of waqf property development be implemented? These questions led to this study to identify the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf property. This study utilised the exploratory research design. Sources are gained from primary and secondary data. The primary data are obtained through in-depth interviews of six waqf practitioners comprising the officials at the State Islamic Religious Council (MAIN), who has been involved in managing waqf properties for more than five years. Secondary data is obtained from previous studies, such as thesis, books, articles, journals, magazines, and other publications. These data are then analysed by using qualitative content analysis using ATLAS. ti Version 8.0 (AV8) software. The results of this study found three elements in the concept of sustainable development of waqf property. The analysis found that there are forms of sustainable development on waqf land that especially involves socio-economic development as it can generate funds and increase the value of waqf property. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper attempts to contextualise the potential role of waqf (plural; awqaf, Islamic perpetual trust) in the contemporary world, particularly, in the developmental arena. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for awqaf to maintain its convergence with some of the fundamental goals of the SDGs which are also congruent with the maqasid al-shariah (the higher objectives of shariah). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a desk-based research, and it adopts the qualitative research paradigm for the analysis of the available literature. Findings: This paper finds that most of the 17 developmental goals of the SDGs comfortably match with the long-term objectives of shariah and there is good scope for the stakeholders of awqaf to develop waqf-based development plan in line with the framework of SDGs. Additionally, it finds that the global awqaf enjoy sufficient financial capacity to help muslim majority countries to realise some of the most relevant and urgent maqasid-oriented SDGs in a timely manner. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this paper is limited to analyse the potential role of global awqaf in realising some of the most urgent maqasid-based development objectives in congruence with SDGs. For the purpose of maintaining the coherence in the focus of the study, this paper does not undertake any comparison between the waqf and other forms of endowments/charities in fulfilling the similar objectives. Practical implications: This paper provides a framework for maqasid-oriented waqf-based development plan followed by provision of some critical recommendations on how the global awqaf can potentially spearhead the initiative of Islamic charities in realising the maqasid-oriented SDGs among muslim majority countries. Originality/value: This paper adds original value to the available literature on the potential of waqf in the arena of development. The paper analyses the role of waqf in achieving the most urgent maqasid-based SDGs, and thus, it fills the existing gap of a systematic research on the possible collaboration of global awqaf and SDGs. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The recent GPI results indicate that many Muslim majority countries score low on the level of peacefulness. Coincidently according to UNDP's Human Development Index these countries also suffer from severe multi-dimensional poverty. Alleviating poverty and increasing the socio-economic well-being are believed to be among the key factors to increase the level of peacefulness. Hence, the study argues that good governance of zakāt funds would be among one of the solutions. This could be done by enhancing the role of mosques as a platform to manage zakāt funds. Proper management of zakāt funds could help contribute to the satisfactory achievement of the peacefulness level. However, a clear and effective system in managing zakāt funds through mosques is yet to be established. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a model of good governance for mosques to manage zakāt funds. In developing a model the study has identified three fundamental units namely: Governance Unit, Recipients Information and Multimedia Unit and Collection and Distribution Unit. It is hoped that the proposed model could contribute to better zakāt management, enhance the role of mosques and achieve peace. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

The approaches that are taken by both of Islamic financial services industry (IFSI) and its counterpart conventional financial services industry (CFSI) are almost similar. However, a distinguished approach is introduced by the Central Bank of Malaysia towards IFSI. While Sharīʽah provides holistic objectives in comparison to SDGs, the approach of value-based intermediation (VBI) opens a new pragmatic dimension for IFSI in providing impactful and beneficial services to the public at large. The end results of VBI are placed to reach the holistic objectives of Sharīʽah and in achieving complete sustainability of IFSI. This paper investigates the approach of VBI and its proposed implementation from Sharīʽah perspective. Depending on qualitative investigation, this paper also explores the practices of Islamic banks in applying VBI through Islamic social finance and its impacts. It is found that VBI facilitates Islamic banks to provide impactful services to their customers and other innovative strategies based on Islamic social finance. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

Based on the questionnaires distributed to 485 micro entrepreneurs from Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) and Pusat Pembangunan Usahawan Asnaf Zakat Selangor, followed by interview sessions with 17 of them, this study found that although asnafs financially perform lower than the AIM sahabats, asnafs are generally more satisfied with their overall conditions. The findings suggested that both types of financing have their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, to improve the current overall practice of microfinance programs in Malaysia, non-repayable programs were recommended to focus on hardcore poor entrepreneurs, whereas repayable programs were advised to focus on the poor category. © 2018, Kolej University Islam Sultan Azlan Shah.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess the feasibility of zakat distribution conducted by zakat community development program, one of the BAZNAS programs in Bringinsari village, Sukorejo subdistrict, Kendal Regency, Central Java using the zakat village index (IDZ). Design/methodology/approach: IDZ has five components in measuring the effectiveness of charity for the welfare of the community is the economic dimension, the dimension of education, dimension of health, social dimension of humanity and dimensions of da’wah. The economic dimension consists of four variables, namely, the presence of productive economic activities, trade centers and access to transportation and logistics services and the presence of access to financial institutions. Findings: Based on IDZ measurement in Bringinsari village, it is found that IDZ of this village is 0.47. It showed that the condition of the village is good enough. As the result of this calculation, Bringinsari village is under consideration to receive zakat funding. Research limitations/implications: This research will be done in Bringinsari village Sukorejo district, Kendal regency from April 1, 2018 until July 2, 2018. Practical implications: Based on the result of IDZ result done in Bringinsari Sukorejo district, Kendal regency, it is gained index calculation result for about 0.47. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the village deserves to get zakat funding. Economic dimension is still low, 0.32. Therefore, in this case, a motivation to help villagers is needed. The exact program in improving the people in Bringinsari based on priority is economic, health, education program in accordance with IDZ calculation. Social implications: The welfare measurement of zakat receiver or mustahiq adopts welfare index (CIBEST). CIBEST model combines material and spiritual fulfillment of human needs quadrants. This index is split into four categories, namely, welfare, material poverty, spiritual poverty and absolute poverty (Puskas BAZNAS, 2016). Originality/value: Based on measurement result that has been obtained, the authors can recommend some program activities to help improving their welfare. There are three dimensions, which IDZ prioritized or considered to be assisted, such as economic dimension, activity program for housewives. If Bringinsari has got an indicator as a good village and the impact is good as well, therefore, it can try to move zakat fund distribution to other villages. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study looks into the possibility of introducing M&M for underprivileged women entrepreneurs in Selangor State.

Data from 330 respondents were collected from female Muslim members of an MFI, namely Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM). The data were analysed by using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings show that women entrepreneurs prefer those Shariah principles that seem easy to comprehend and preserve their interests. They possess primary knowledge of M&M and fairly practise intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity, but lack proper entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, application of M&M would be viable if clients’ knowledge of Shariah and M&M were improved along with their religiosity and entrepreneurial skills. These findings would help include M&M within the context of microfinancing. © 2019, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

Deforestation is one of the main contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions, ecosystem degradation, and from there the rising cases of poverty in the developing world. Their impacts on the economy and environment of OIC member countries has been devastating. Desertification and deforestation are caused by human activities like logging, harmful farming practices, as well as haphazard cutting of trees in order to make way for city buildings and farms. The paper shows that poor handling of past responses to desertification problems can be solved with the right approaches. It first looks at existing approaches to the problem and causes of their failure. Then, it proposes an alternative model based on fiqh teachings and recent developments in Islamic economics and finance.

	abstract = {The absence of the bottom line in not-for-profit organisations (NPO) restrains the rendering of accounts. A waqf institution is no exception. It is one of the crucial components of Islamic social finance, which eventuates in social benefits. Therefore, accountability in such faith-based institution is crucial for achieving their socio-economic impact. The relevance of waqf institutions will be examined in relation to their socio-economic impact, focusing on the impact of programs and activities using waqf funds, rather than focusing merely on expenses and outputs. This impact is particularly pertinent as, in Malaysia, waqf matters are under the jurisdiction of State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRC) in the respective region. This paper aims to develop the measurements for socio-economic impact of waqf institutions. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the appropriate measurements for input, output, outcome, impact, effectiveness, and efficiency. The lack of performance disclosure found in this study indicates the need for comprehensive performance measurements concerning socio-economic impact. This study also conducted a benchmarking analysis to examine the presentation of performance measurement at Majlis Ugama Islam Singapora (MUIS). Reviewing their annual reports promoted the practicality of such reporting. The fact that it is similar with the mandatory disclosure on financial statements, socio-economic impact is also viewed as important since the primary focus of waqf itself is for social well-being. This study therefore proposes numerous indicators for socio-economic impact, specifically for waqf. This is to garner trust among the waqf givers (waqif), to enhance accountability and promote transparency toward sustainability of waqf institutions.. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {The Nigeria agricultural sector is faced with many predicaments, such as insufficient modern agricultural tools and facilities, loss of focus, abandonment, and inadequate motivation of farmers. In the history of Nigeria, agriculture contributed significantly to national development and poverty reduction. Such was the case before Nigeria found petroleum. The majority of Nigerian tribes were focused, committed and invested in agriculture. Poverty is rampant and common among Muslims in Nigeria especially in the northern parts of the country. Inequality and low productivity have contributed to poor standards of living in the country. The large number of Muslims in Africa, specifically the Nigeria populace, lives below $2 a day due to their abject and absolute poverty (World Bank Development Report, 2013). The Muslim community accounts for a significant number of poor and less privileged in Nigeria. Waqf assets comprise of movable and immovable properties such as cash and land. Waqf is a form of Islamic endowment that has enormous unexplored potential for its application in fulfilling social needs of the poor. One such need is for the establishment of more effective schemes to alleviate poverty among the less privileged Muslims through agribusiness that would provide enormous advantages. The objective of this paper is to examine how waqf properties can be channelled into agribusiness on cocoa, palm tree oil and cotton farm projects that will assist in empowering the needy Nigerian Muslims. The research applied both qualitative and quantitative to examine the applicability of Cash Waqf funds coupled with land for the aforementioned purpose. The study proposes strategies through which waqf properties can be used for the generation of income and reduction of poverty in Nigeria a highly populated nation. It is believed that employment opportunities will be enhanced through the proper management of such projects. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The paper investigates whether the extensive use of banking logic changes IMFs, from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts mixed methods by analyzing 7,200 microfinance data from Microfinance Exchange Market and reviewing annual reports and websites of 25 IMFs to examine their vision and mission statements and other related information. Findings: The finding shows Islamic microfinance has not changed, despite increasing adoption of financial or banking performance measures. However, size and age of the institutions may affect the outcome in the future. The authors find that smaller microfinance institutions maintain genuine objective to serve the poor, as the grow larger they would be more inclined toward sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited on the sample size as data on Islamic microfinance globally is limited. However, the paper looked at the global data rather than local data to compensate for this limitation. Future study would be further taking the study through qualitative methods to support the study. Originality/value: This paper aims to shed some lights on the process of mission drifting or abandoning poverty objective by IMFIs. The paper investigates how has the extensive use of financing logic has changed IMFIs from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Arun and Hulme (2009) argued that the interaction of multiple logic within microfinance institutions, i.e. financial vs social, could pose some serious management dilemmas within microfinance institutions. Further, commercialization puts pressure on the field staffs to achieve financial targets and often neglect their poverty outreach mission to the poor. The well-known crisis in Andhra Pradesh, India where clients of microfinance institutions committed suicide after being shamed by field officers who tried to collect payments of loans (Mader, 2013; Taylor, 2011), provides a powerful case of the impact of financialization to microfinance clients. © 2019, Luqyan Tamanni and Mohd Hairul Azrin Haji Besar.},

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOS’s management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOS’s financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOS’s not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010. Such trace enables Islamic SACCOS and other stakeholders to be aware on the financial progress of Islamic SACCOS and act accordingly to ensure sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This condition is represented by disparity between potential and actual collection. In Islam, the objective of zakat is not only to collect wealth and keep it idle, instead zakat should become a source of productive fund to fulfill societal needs. Some countries with advanced zakat institutions have developed zakat to become a pillar of economic development. Today, each zakat institution is competing against each other to innovate in zakat fund management. Empowerment in zakat institutions with the appropriate strategies will enhance zakat management and distribution for the betterment of zakat recipients (mustahiq) and the Muslim society at large.

Under the classical fiqh approach, the potential amount of zakat was calculated based on the zakatable assets that have been agreed upon by all scholars, including only zakat on savings. Meanwhile, using the contemporary fiqh approach, the zakat potential was calculated based on a new classification of zakatable assets agreed by contemporary scholars after considering the issue of economic development, including professional (household) zakat, corporate zakat and zakat on savings. The results show that, based on the classical fiqh approach, the potential zakat amount is IDR 69.57 trillion, or equivalent to 0.56% of GDP under the optimistic scenario, and it is IDR 13.26 trillion, or equivalent to 0.11% of GDP, under the realistic scenario. Meanwhile, based on the contemporary fiqh approach, the potential zakat amount is IDR 216.54 trillion, or equivalent to 1.75% of GDP, under the optimistic scenario, and it is IDR 74.87 trillion, or equivalent to 0.60% of GDP, under the realistic scenario. The estimated zakat potentials are still significantly higher than actual zakat collection recorded. However, the results of classical approach under the realistic scenario (0.11% of GDP) is the closest to the real 2018 zakat collection of 0.05% of GDP, which could be the indication that most Indonesian Muslims follow classical fiqh approach in calculating their zakat maal obligation. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

The discussion focuses on shelter, immediate and urgent needs, medical, human development, and other related challenges. The value and importance of waqf endowment cannot be under estimated and ignored. Cash waqf is a modern financial instrument for socio-economic development in solving social issues and challenges confronting Muslims globally. The study adopts a library method to reach solutions to outstanding problems. Waqf management across Nigeria should develop mechanism for interaction with state and local authorities and many other NGOs whose interest is to provide financial support to IDPs in Nigeria.

	abstract = {Despite the importance of microfinancing as a tool for alleviating poverty, formal financial institutions, such as banks, are reluctant to provide this type of financing. There is, therefore, a need to provide financing indirectly through linkage programs. Launched by Bank Indonesia on January 9, 2004, the linkage program is the first pillar of the Indonesian Banking Architecture, and serves as a comprehensive framework for the development of the Indonesian banking industry. The program provides financing through cooperatives to their members operating microbusinesses. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of linkage pro-grams provided by Islamic banks for microfinancing through Islamic cooperatives known as houses of charity (baitul maal wa tamwil, BMT). This research was conducted by using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative information was collected using in-depth interviews with the management and author-ized officers from five BMTs that are knowledgeable about such cooperatives. The quantitative research was conducted by analyzing the cooperatives’ financial statements and conducting a direct survey of the recipients of financing. The effectiveness of a microfinancing program is commonly measured by three aspects, known as the “the triangle of microfinance.” These aspects are the extent to which the financing provides for the poor (outreach), whether it increases the income or assets of the target population (impact), and the business sur-vival of institutions managing the financing (institution sustainability). We found that linkage programs had a positive impact, especially on improving the affordability of outreach in small and medium-sized but not in the large BMTs. We suggest that the Indonesian Bank or Indonesian Financial Service Authority should specifically encourage medium-sized cooperatives or BMTs to employ this program by providing more incentives for banks or reducing the barriers for BMTs to participate. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Poverty alleviation initiatives by conventional mechanisms often keep the contribution of Islamic mechanisms in the shadows. This study will shed light on the ability of an Islamic Charitable Institution in contributing toward the economic growth in Malaysia through an endowment mechanism grounded on Waqf philosophy. Theory of Well-Being is incorporated with the Maslahah (Maslahah) principle of Maqasid al- Shari'ah (Maqāsid al-Shaī'ah) to elaborate the importance of Islamic Charitable Institutions (ICIs) in a South Asian country. This study first focuses on determining the long-run and short-run equilibrium relationships between donation and economic development using Unit Root model. Then, the causality between donation and economic indicators are measured using OLS regression and Granger causality test. Data for annual donation is collected from the financial reports of Lembaga Amanah Kolej Islam Malaya (LAKIM) for the year 2000 to 2013 while economic development is measured through GDP data provided by World Bank. Donations distributed by LAKIM for the enhancement of higher education in Malaysia are found to have a significantly long and short-run effect on economic growth. While OLS regression has proved the significant positive impact of donation on GDP, Granger causality test proved that GDP Granger causes donations. Management of LAKIM will be able to understand their role in the economic development of Malaysia which might influence them to become more involved through various innovative schemes to benefit the Maslahah. The study has included a time series that is limited to only fourteen years, and thus the volatility of donations could not be measured through ARCH family models. This study is the first to explore the ability of LAKHVf in contributing to the Maslahah through economic development of a developing country using econometric models that are backed by the Theory of Well-Being and Maqasid al- Shari'ah. © 2018 Islamic Cultural Centre.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Islam guides us in poverty alleviation based on the principles of justice and equitable distribution of wealth. Islam provides practical guidelines for economic problems through both market and non-market mechanisms. Islamic finance provides a model that identifies individual differences among people not only from the perspective of equitable opportunities for all but also from providing other means for addressing economic problems. This presentation takes a deep dive into "Waqf" as a rewarding economic system. I present an alternative view of Waqf integrating it as a component of the traditional economic system. I explain how Waqf increases aggregate consumption, expenditure, and expand national income. A cross-country review of current state of Waqf practices is included for comparative analysis. It helps to grasp a complete understanding of challenges and issues in Waqf globally. Lack of trust in Waqf managers and institutions is the key factor why, despite being the best social capital model, the practice of Waqf is relatively low in Muslim majority countries. Evidence is there that in many cases financial greed takes over the financial objective creating a fear of permanent loss among the endowers. Moreover, investments of Waqf fund are not well diversified and not invested properly to generate income to support waqf assets. To get the most out of Waqf asset, strategic alignments of Waqf funds and stakeholders are necessary at the institutional level. In the final section of this presentation, I suggest a comprehensive legal framework that adequately addresses major financial, agency, and governance issues pertaining to Waqf. A Waqf friendly legal environment coupled with preferential tax treatment for the endowed funds is crucial in achieving the intended goal of Islamic finance through Waqf as its vehicle. © 2018, Islamic Bank Training and Research Academy.},

The paper aims to define an integrated approach for building, maintaining and upgrading Islamic social finance and sustainable ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a conceptual framework based on case studies and literature review describing the methodology and the necessary steps to build sustainable ecosystems. Findings: The paper shows the impact of building social finance ecosystems on tackling social issues. It emphasizes the idea that solving social issues is everybody’s business – from governments to businesses – and that those initiatives require sufficient Sharīʿah-compliant funding to achieve sustainability goals. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not focus on the Islamic world experiences in building ecosystems serving social causes. Practical implications: The paper gives an overview on how collaboration between the different social oriented organisations can enhance the social impact of the different initiatives. The aim is to ensure adequate financing to all the ecosystem components during the whole lifecycle. Social implications: The suggested approach of building sustainable ecosystems can serve as a way to assess the existing social initiatives and practices to find relevant combinations targeting more impact. Originality/value: In the social sphere, the idea of building ecosystems has been explored in different ways but never in a way that gathers all the components including finance providers, coordinators and the different types of initiatives. The paper adapts the ecosystem concept to the Islamic finance specificities. © 2019, Ahmed Tahiri Jouti.},

In spite of many poverty alleviation policies and interventions of the past three decades, millions of Nigerians still live in abject poverty, while thousands of university graduates roam the streets looking for jobs. Many unemployed Nigerians with good business ideas are usually discouraged by the alarmingly high interest rate charged on start-up capitals by local banks. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve its objective, this paper used both analytical and qualitative methods after thoroughly examining many relevant literature and empirical works. The study explores four Sharī’ah tools for the implementation of the proposed scheme, to wit: musharakah, mudharabah, zakat and waqf. Findings: The study finds that the suggested Sharī’ah tools are viable and sustainable in lunching microfinance projects in the Nigerian context. The paper further argues that exploring Islamic non-interest microfinance options will guarantee the financial inclusion of a large percentage of Nigerians, pursuant to the Constitutional provision on economic rights of the entire citizenry (s.16 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended).

	abstract = {Waqf has a significant role in economic development and social welfare. The Waqf paradigm in Indonesia is limited to immovable assets such as land and buildings. In fact, Law No. 41 of 2004 concerning Waqf also regulates assets other than immovable property. One of these assets is Intellectual Property Rights. The economic potential of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) becomes an opportunity to realize prosperity for the community. This paper identifies IPR regimes that can be used as waqf and constraints in their implementation. The results show that the regulation of entire IPR Law allows the rights transfer through waqf with several adjustments, i.e., the term of the Copyright waqf must be adjusted to the period of copyright protection in Indonesia. In addition, the transfer of rights in the copyright waqf only covers Economic Rights. This means that Moral Rights are still attached to waqif. Constraints to the implementation of IPR waqf include the absence of legal rules at the technical level as a direction to waqif and Nazhir to carry out the transfer of rights. Another obstacle found was the absence of the role of Indonesian Waqf Board (BWI) in improving Nazhir's competence regarding Intellectual Property Rights. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The productive waqf is considered as a key instrument for providing funds to actualizing its educational program. Since both productive waqf and pesantren emphasize sustainability, and since productive waqf can assist to support the process of education in pesantren, the study aims to investigate an integrated Islamic social and commercial economy model applicable in pesantren. This will ensure utilization of the combined resources of productive waqf and pesantren in promoting pesantren welfare. The study focuses on 263 operational chief, assatidz or teacher, musyrif, musyrifah or santri companion and santri or students in Pesantren in Java and Sumatra using. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) adopted to examine the relationship among the five constructs i.e., productive waqf, business unit, project financing, human resource and pesantren welfare. While the reliability and validity are established, the structural relationship between the constructs reveals that the integrated model has a strong relationship with the pesantren welfare in many ways. In relation with business unit and profitable commercial activities, human resources have its significant role to assist pesantren tries its level best to realize developed productive waqf. Specifically, the result shows all five constructs have significant impact in promoting pesantren welfare, which suggests that the model as well as the instrument should be further implemented in pesantren. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {One of the advantages of using Islamic social funds is the increased ability of microfinance institutions to provide financial services to the poor. This study aims to (1) investigate the characteristics of the clients of Islamic Charity Based Microfinance (ICBM) programmes; (2) test whether the clients of ICBM programmes are more vulnerable than a non-client group; and (3) discuss the rationale for excluding the poor from zakat-based microfinance programmes. The study examined the microfinance programmes of various zakat institutions, namely Baitul Maal Muamalat (BMMI), BAZNAS and Baitul Maal Beringharjo (BMB). A total of 236 respondents made up of the clients and non-clients of three case study institutions participated in this study. The data were analysed using a binomial logit model to evaluate the factors affecting client participation in ICBM programmes in Indonesia. The findings show that the ICBM clients and non-clients have a similar demographic profile and that the majority of ICBM clients, while living above the national poverty line, live perilously close to its edge. Using logistic regression, the study found that the higher the client’s income level, the greater their probability of being selected for the programme. This finding contradicts the existing Islamic microfinance literature which claims that ICBM institutions in general could demonstrate the capacity to extend their services more widely to the poorest if Islamic charity was the main source of microfinance funding. The study highlights some of the potential barriers to including the poor in microfinance, including an institutional selection policy and self-exclusion factors. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

The paper is a qualitative research project, performed through analysis of literature regarding current confusion points pertaining to the areas of infaq, sadaqah, zakat, cash waqf, corporate waqf, and traditional waqf. An ideal social safety net is attainable by focusing on poverty, giving special attention to economic empowerment programs. Zakat should play a supporting role in abating hunger for people in the transition while counterbalancing inequalities created by market imperfections. Since zakat funds cannot be used for social infrastructure development, traditional waqf should fulfil these needs among vulnerable people. Additionally, contemporary forms of cash waqf and corporate waqf are essential in mobilizing resources for social infrastructure development. In contrast to existing literature, this paper provides an alternative blueprint for Islamic social investment and transfer, clearly delineating the roles of infaq, sadaqah, zakat, and waqf. Different Islamic social investment and transfer tools should function like prongs, each acting in a separate sphere, working to serve the same ultimate purpose. ©The Authors.},

On the other hand, one of the zakat objectives is helping mustahik (zakat recipients) in the economic sphere. They received zakat because of limitations in the necessity of life, both in short and long period. This research aimed to explore how zakat funds improve their welfare, particularly in the sub-district of Jepara, which consists of fourteen villages. The observation and interview technics utilized for information assembly, then analyzed by Milnes and Huberman model. The results indicated that BAZNAS (Badan Amil Zakat Nasional), as a national zakat board empowered ZIS (zakat, infaq, and shodaqoh) funds through four models. The first, the consumptive model aimed to help mustahik fulfill the needs in a short period, such as giving compensation to the poor and orphans. The second, the creative consumptive model, that gave direct assistance such as medical expenses, wheelchairs, and house renovation. The third, the traditional productive model that gave productive goods to whom has certain skills, such as sewing machines for a sewing expert and goats for a livestock expert. The fourth, the creative production model, which invested some of the ZIS funds to develop health clinics in collaboration with the Islamic University in Jepara. The results also obtained that ZIS fundraising is too small, furthermore, BAZNAS should increase creativity, innovation and notice that the presence of a companion team was important to support the success of empowerment program. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Zakat (alms-giving) is a model of revenue distribution in Islamic Law. The historical concept of zakat is an Islamic state income. Islamic government collects zakat from wealthy moslem because they are obliged to take at least 2.5 % from their wealth to be donated to the poor. The collected funds of zakat were pooled in baitul maal (state treasury funds). The State then allocates them for mustahiq zakat (the recipient of zakat). Recently, the way moslems pay zakat especially in Indonesia has turned into individual obligatory expense (separated from the state budget). They usually complete zakat payment through traditional amil (zakat collectors) or nationally-registered zakat collecting institutions. It means that zakat is not purely a part of state income. However, the release of Indonesian Law Number 23, 2011 on Zakat Management brings about the discourse of the position of zakat in Indonesian Treasury Funds. It regulates the tax regressive for zakat payment provided that there is a valid receipt from registered amil. Later, the registered amil has to send an annual financial report to Official Zakat Collecting Institution and Indonesian Department for Religious Affairs. This mechanism raises the potency of national income generated from zakat. However, the later obstacle is how to manage zakat based on the principle of accountability and to avoid zakat abuse. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The main objective of this research is to assess service satisfaction with the distribution of zakat and the effect it can have on the recipients' social and financial status; and, whether this religious tradition which is deeply embedded in the society can supplement social services provision. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the responses of 192 program recipients. Focusing on responses of the recipients the results highlighted concerns related to investment and distribution of zakat. The findings concluded that contemporary zakat administration, when provided in a rural district, needs to be standardized and clearly follow guidelines for mandatory implementation. This standardization of distribution of zakat closely following the rules and laws would lead to more effective and efficient distribution helping to eliminate any current inequalities of the re-distribution of wealth. In addition to its religious value base which conforms to societal norms, zakat funds can help to decrease poverty within a community. The results show that using zakat, with its religious and spiritual traditions that are deeply embedded in the society, provide an excellent basis for supporting social work and social services provision.

Previous researches on IMFI sustainability generally viewed the financial and social or the spiritual aspect as segregated elements. There is hardly any empirical investigation that integrated these three aspects in an effort to achieve sustainability. Thus, this research is expected to fill the gap by proposing a holistic approach for achieving IMFI sustainability. This study used survey method on 98 units of sharia cooperatives/Baitul Maal Wattamwil (BMTs) using a structured questionnaires based on Likert scale of 5 points. The previous holistic approach was developed based on the literature review and the responses of IMFI's experts. Partial least square path modeling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. The results show that financial, social and spiritual intermediation has a positively significant effect on IMFI's sustainability in Indonesia. These results also show that IMFI's sustainability problem can be overcome by applying holistic approach. The study is focused on Islamic Micro Finance Institution (IMFI). The future study is expected to observe the impact of this holistic approach on the lives of the poor and on the performance of micro-enterprises as beneficiaries of IMFI. This study is the first empirical one to examine the sustainability of IMFI using a holistic approach. It also provides new contribution to the IMFI's intermediary concept from the double bottom line-as known so far-has become a triple mission of IMFI. © 2018 Allied Academies.},

	abstract = {It is inconceivable to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level without accomplishing them locally. In the Arab region, municipalities face challenges to meet a widening gap between expenses and revenues. Securing a locally based sustainable financing model is of paramount importance. Wāqf is a value-based funding model that can offer new opportunities for sustainable financing to achieve SDGs locally. It agrees with Islamic law with the intent to promote social cohesion. The paper examines whether Wāqf, as a financing modality, is a Social Innovation (SI) model and its potential to finance development at the local level. The research method applied in this paper is qualitative. The authors compiled over 50 published articles, books, and reports covering the Wāqf and SI. The paper attempts to establish and explain linkages between Wāqf and both SI and SDGs. Content analysis using qualitative data analysis software is the research technique the researchers applied. The paper argues that Wāqf is an SI model. It can fund municipal initiatives that contribute to achieving SDGs. Results reveal linkages between Wāqf and SI and show that they contribute to sustainable development in human settlements. Besides, they both play a decisive role in fostering social equity, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Wāqf is a value-based financing model that satisfies the conditions and attributes of SI. Wāqf is an instrumental tool for financing development and supporting the attainment of SDGs in cities and municipalities. To harness the potential of Wāqf as an enabler for SDGs, organizational and business model innovation are needed to ensure transparency, accountability, and organizational learning. © 2019, Arabian Gulf University.

The objective of this article is to provide for a brief picture of the zakat management in Indonesia. The findings of the research conducted that it was found in 2011 that the Zakat agencies have been able to manage up to ten billion rupiahs which distribution covers the whole parts of Indonesia. Nevertheless, in Indonesia zakat has a big potential, by having 87% of Muslim populations and 20% of them are assumed as the zakat givers (muzakki). Therefore as it was reported in 2011 that the potential value of zakat was around Rp 217 trillions. In addition, the zakat added with infaq calculated around Rp 1.5 trillion per year. Meaning that the zakat collected has not reached even more than 1 percent of the potential zakat per year. Even though the number of Muslim people in Indonesia is very significant, the problems centered in the management of the zakat which is still in traditional pattern where the zakat givers (muzakki) give directly to the persons who has the right to receive zakat (mustahik). It is suggested that it need revolutionary improvement in the zakat management, there must be a mindset changing from traditional management to modern zakat management where the zakat officer (amil zakat) must be a professional one, and permanent job basis. This surely will improve the zakat management and the poverty will surely be eliminated. This research used empirical methods including the effectiveness and impact of the law. © 2019 Sriwijaya University. All rights reserved.},

It is argued that the number of Muslims living in poverty is growing faster than the number of Zakat payers which reflect the low compliance towards the act of paying Zakat among Muslims. Thus, this study seeks to understand the religious practice and attitude of the Zakat payers that influence their willingness to comply towards the behaviour of paying Zakat. This study provides the theoretical insight by combining the element in Theory of Reasoned Action (1980) and the measurement of Muslim Religiosity-Personality Inventory (2005) in a single model which provides multidimensional findings in Zakat compliance behaviour. Data from 217 respondents were recorded and the respondents were consisted of public and private sectors? employees. The data were then analysed using SPSS. The existing variable; attitude, subjective norm and religiosity were found to be statistically significant on Zakat compliance behaviour. The implications of this study will enhance the Zakat institution to increase the Zakat collection in the future and to improve the institutional way by focusing on specific target group to increase the voluntary behaviour in order for the members to pay Zakat. It may also helps in developing an extensive way of understanding the individual?s behaviour on complying towards the act of Zakat and empowering the community development in Malaysia. © 2018, Universita Putra Malaysia.},

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative method is used in this research. An extensive review of the literature has been conducted. Latest literature on refugees, microfinance has been critically examined beside the current cash waqf models. Findings: Empirical studies have shown that many refugees are equipped with marketable skills and talents that can be utilised to improve their socio-economic situations. The proposed model – cash waqf refugee microfinance fund (CWRMF) – is structured to extend microfinance to potential refugee micro entrepreneurs. To address the lack of collateral, which is a requirement to gain any microfinance, CWRMF has been incorporated with a takaful unit (cooperation) by which refugees may guarantee each other. Additionally, the model has also been structured to address the challenge of sustainability of the institution that would provide microfinance. Hence, a reserve fund has also been integrated into the model. Practical implications: CWRMF represents a potential model to be implemented by humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and aid agencies to support livelihood of refugees in particular for Muslim refugees. Positive outcome is expected from the implementation of this model. This is because of the various advantages of microfinance programs not only on refugees but also on concerned NGOs, host populations and donor parties. Additionally, this paper is a set of primarily thoughts aims to open the door wider for more researchers to explore the potential of cash waqf as one of the instruments to finance refugee microenterprises and business activities. Originality/value: Recently cash waqf has been into several models for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation.

The state takes an intervention role with several social programs to solve social issues. On the other hand, the charity tradition is one of the important aspects in life including the doctrine of every religion. The purpose of this research is to observe the Indonesian people who still own the charity tradition came from their religious tradition Islam teaches charity through zakat, infak, shadaqah and wakaf (ZISWAF) which has existed in the society as the symbol of the social piety. This research uses sociological approach and qualitative method while the method of collecting data uses observation, interview and study of documentation. As for the analysis, the analysis of descriptive qualitative uses the theory of Social Justice Philanthropy in charity tradition as the spontaneous action of human if they see another human is treated unfairly by state or more authorized person. The results of the research are: first, the philanthropy institution is oriented on destitute family which is unfinished handled by the state through PNPM program in charity social service because the target of the program is destitute group so it has not finished yet. Second, the philanthropy institution on its movement is built in the name of religious spirit capitalized into Social Justice Philanthropy. Third, the philanthropy institution in the empowerment of destitute society is followed by mastery which does not only focus on charity, capacity but also on authority by creating destitute family must be an entrepreneur. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

Despite this, microfinance continues to face various issues and challenges that hinder its effective functioning, resulting in many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to operate at sub-optimal level, thus fail to achieve their objectives. This study attempts to discern the issues and challenges facing the Islamic MFIs by focusing on the experience of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM), one of the world’s largest Islamic MFIs, and subsequently propose possible solutions to address those issues. In methodology, the study conducts a survey questionnaire regarding potential issues and challenges of Islamic microfinance on 402 women micro-entrepreneurs who are currently clients of several AIM centres in Hulu Selangor. In efforts to get enriching insights, we further relate those issues with the demographic profile of the clients.

	abstract = {Purpose: Though microfinance has been working for many years as a tool to eradicate poverty from its root, most of the least developed and developing countries are yet to significantly alleviate it from the society. The purpose of this paper is to focus on Shariah-based microfinance products in the context of sustainable poverty alleviation approach and provide them financial benefits to enhance their livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach: Here, this qualitative study critically analyzes the basics of the sustainable Islamic microfinance to exterminate the level of poverty. Findings: Islamic microfinance is a more ethical practice than the traditional motives of profit maximization, and it encourages extending the time of repayment if the debtors are in hardship. In some case, it suggests to give charity if the creditor has capability. Research limitations/implications: Most importantly, research scholars and experts have already criticized the concept of conventional microfinance on the basis of various points, especially for its high rate of interest. Social implications: Islamic microfinance is provided with a view to fulfill two tools simultaneously, i.e., social and financial inclusion. In this case, credits and Zakah can be given to the extreme poor people for satisfying basic needs. In terms of social responsibility, Islam encourages the people to be soft in case of collecting the lending money. Originality/value: The study discoursed that sustainable Islamic Microfinance (IM) may be a promising future option to draw the attention of the religiously sensitive people toward the Shariah-based microfinance which can, in turn, mitigate the poverty level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to enhance the impact of incorporated waqf institutions by blending their resources to promote responsible small businesses that are inclusive of human development, service to society and preservation of ecological environment and other species. This is expected to shift the paradigm of businesses from the current waste-oriented linear economy to ideally a zero-waste circular economy. Design/methodology/approach: This is an analytical study building on the experience of European Venture Philanthropy Organizations (VPOs) that work with the primary objective of making impactful businesses successful, with capital protection and return on investment being of secondary concern. This paper suggests an incorporated institutional design that blends resources for promoting responsible businesses using a new hybrid financial mechanism, namely, equity-at-default (EaD) to replace collateral and foreclosure requirements with responsibility and compassion. Findings: The research calls for changing the business paradigm from linear to circular, an incorporated institutional framework for venture waqf, purpose of the waqf to make impactful small businesses successful and designing a financial contract to loan in favor of responsible businesses that convert to equity stake for the waqf in case of default (EaD) replacing collateral and foreclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications: This is a theoretical study motivated by the success of VPOs but assigns a new role to waqf institutions. Furthermore, the incorporated nature of waqf is a new idea and EaD is a new mechanism. Being new, these ideas have the risk of not being implemented. However, the broader message that waqf shall promote businesses that are inclusive of ecological concerns is generally applicable. Practical implications: The paper has a significant practical implication to transform the responsibility and consciousness of businesses. Waqf is fundamentally a compassionate institution, and it must enhance the responsibility of businesses to become more inclusive of the environment and other species. It should also become more compassionate toward businesses that are in distress and default. In this sense, the paper tries to internalize compassion in financial contracting that can potentially change the architecture of lending. Social implications: Altering businesses’ mindset from a waste-driven extractive linear economy to inclusive circular economy has a tremendous transformative role. This will have implications for enhancing business consciousness and responsibility. As poverty is a phenomenon of state of mind, changing the society’s state of thought in Muslim communities is expected to have basic positive implications. Entrepreneurs with a new mindset can have far-reaching positive impacts on the society. Originality/value: The paper offers potentially innovative perspectives in four key areas and blends the different resources in an incorporated waqf that makes responsible entrepreneurs assume a partnership role in times of distress through EaD. Furthermore, the integration of compassion in financial contracting could have better implications for return on investment as well. The ideal state of an economy is where waste is turned into wealth and well-being is something that all policymakers must keep on the top of their agendas. © 2019, Tariqullah Khan.},

	abstract = {The central focus of the Islamic economic system is on socioeconomic justice and the overall welfare of society, especially at the bottom of the pyramid segment. Qard-al-Hassan, alongside zakat and sadaqah, is one of the instruments for the redistribution of income and wealth from the rich to the poor in Islam. In 2007, Bangladesh was struck by super cyclone SIDR, leaving 3,406 people dead. Moreover, SIDR caused unprecedented damage to homes, crops and livelihoods. The Fael Khair Waqf (FKW) Program came as a response to the urgent need to assist the victims of the cyclone and initiated an interest-free micro-loan (Qard-al-Hassan) scheme to restore the livelihoods of a large segment of the victims and to lift them out of poverty. While investigating the effectiveness of Qard-al-Hassan in poverty reduction, this paper also examines the FKW program as a case study. Analysis was conducted of 1600 households using an independent sample t-test and logistic regression to investigate to what extent the program has been effective in reducing poverty. The findings of the logistic analysis are that the probability of being poor for FKW participants is around 1.46 times lower than for non-participants. Moreover, the Qard-al-Hassan of FKW lowers the cost of borrowing significantly and hence participants can accumulate more assets, which might help them to improve their economic status. Overall, the effectiveness of the program implies that development practitioners and researchers should promote the outreach of Qard-al-Hassan so that the extreme poor can easily avail themselves of the services. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Design/methodology/approach: The study mainly applied the commonly used Tuckman and Chang’s (1991) model to measure the financial health of non-profits. Content and ratio analysis of the 2014 audited reports of seven institutions were used to determine their equity balance, revenue concentration, administrative costs and operating margin ratios. Findings: The results indicate that only one waqf institution was financially sustainable in all the four components. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used are not the latest and focussed only on a single year, the findings may not be necessarily true, currently. Second, the study focussed only on Malaysia. Thus, the results may not be generalisable to other waqfs in other countries or to privately managed waqf institutions. Accordingly, future research should address these limitations. Practical implications: The findings provide useful insights into the financial sustainability of waqf institutions and highlight the need for policymakers in Malaysia and other Muslim countries to give due attention to the holistic accountability of waqf institutions to ensure waqf’s systematic revival.

Poor people account for approximately 30 million out of a population of 250 million people in Indonesia. Decisions by local officials as well as the behaviour of the community can be influenced by empowering zakat and zakat management systems in an efficient manner. The problems addressed by this writing are as follows: What is the potential of collecting development funds for poverty alleviation through zakat? What is the role of local governments in empowering people in the field of zakat management? and What is the strategic model for using the law as a means of social engineering in the field of zakat management? This problem will be solved using a qualitative socio-legal research approach. Banyumas Regency is the area of study, as it has a poverty alleviation program through BAZDA. Based on the results of the study, each region has the potential to extract development funds with different degrees of success. To enhance understanding, this study conducted a questionnaire survey that dealt with the various indicators of poverty and how zakat management dynamics can influence them. Results of this study indicates that an efficient zakat management system is centralized, distributed, and delegated. Such systems lead to good outcomes for poverty dynamics, like inability to drive to work and increased dependence on foreign aids. Additionally, centralized zakat management dynamics are also contributing to the lowering of substandard living conditions and poor medical treatment among community members. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Poverty is multifaceted and can be measured using both objective and subjective approaches. Objective approach viewed poverty in terms of quantitatively measurable indicators of welfare; whereas, the subjective poverty measured poverty according to personal judgment of individuals regarding their own welfare. Understanding this multifaceted poverty is important as it will lead to efficient intervention schemes and strategies to reduce poverty. Currently, zakat institution utilize objective measures that is poverty line income (PLI) and zakat poverty line (haddul kifayah). This interest is motivated by the concern on why individuals felt they are poor and deserve to receive zakat yet, their applications are rejected due to the objective indicators which indicate them as non-poor individuals. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to analyze determinants of subjective poverty among zakat applicants. This study surveyed on zakat applicants among asnaf poor and needy in three district of Melaka: Melaka Tengah, Jasin and Alor Gajah. The findings showed that demographic, socio-economic background, household type, marital status, education, financial stress, income, wealth and debt effects on why applicants felt poor.

	abstract = {Engaging in social responsibility practices is currently being viewed as essential to Islamic organizations. The potential of using waqf as a source of funding for such practices has not been vastly explored. The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the current corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) and to examine the viability of using waqf for the purpose of CSR. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of twenty-four (24) IFIs in Malaysia for a four (4) year period from 2010 to 2013 were undertaken to provide insights on their current CSR practices. The CSR disclosure items were categorized into vital and recommended items, where the vital elements denote key activities that are essential and are to be undertaken while the recommended items refer to discretionary activities that may be carried out. Semi-structured interviews with three (3) Waqf experts were also carried out to draw their opinions about waqf. The results of the study revealed that for the vital items, the IFIs in Malaysia were focusing their CSR practices on the workplace while for the recommended items the focus was on community issues. Corporate waqf is viewed as a viable alternative that organizations can use to help address social issues of the community. However, there are critical issues that needed to be dealt with to transformed waqf practices in the country. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In Pakistan, where approximately sixty percent (60%) of the population is living below the international poverty line, Islamic microfinance has the potential to play a vital role in alleviating poverty. Unfortunately, the banking sector of Pakistan is reluctant to contribute in Islamic microfinance due to some limitations from the bankers’ perspective. Qualitative approach has been followed in this study in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-six participants from all over Pakistan, including five from Islamic, seven from conventional, thirteen from microfinance and one from an Islamic microfinance bank. Interviews were conducted with the board of directors, Sharīʿah board members, senior management, and microfinance heads. According to the experts, the mindset of bankers, lack of collateral, weak role of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the government of Pakistan in setting targets, limited availability of sector targeted products, lack of customer awareness, lack of initial capital, time consumption and documentation problems are among the issues faced by the banking sector. These experts emphasized the crucial role of the SBP and government support to promote Islamic microfinancing through banks. State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) as regulator and other commercial banks, Islamic microfinance banks and their boards of directors, Sharīʿah board members, senior management, and microfinance heads can implement the outcomes of this study. © 2019, University of Management and Technology.

	abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the imperative of social impact measurements in Islamic finance by exploring the growing interest of Islamic social finance and social impact. From critical review of literature, the paper finds that despite the tremendous growth of the Islamic finance industry, little is known about how Islamic finance institutions measure their social values, and how they report their social impact. The ongoing criticisms of Islamic finance failing to fulfil its “raison d’etre” and underlying objectives provides an indication of that there is a gap between its theory and practice. More focus towards developing Islamic social finance and integrating Islamic financial instruments with the mainstream social finance spectrum may help address these criticisms. In doing so, the paper posits the need to expand the definition of Islamic social finance beyond just zakāt, waqf and Islamic microfinance. Furthermore, the paper also proposes that mechanisms or frameworks for Islamic financial institutions to measure the social impact of their operations, products and services should be developed to realise the full potential of Islamic finance. This can be done through a stakeholder-based approach and assimilating frameworks of Value-Based Intermediation, Maqāṣid al-Sharīʽah, and Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {From the end of World War Two, the core methodology of law and development projects has been to transplant the best legal institutions of Western capitalism to poor and emerging economies. In many post-colonial contemporary Muslim-majority countries, such programs have not adequately engaged with local legal systems, cultures and traditions. Contrary to the restrictive modernist approach to law and development, and inspired by the Sharia, there are numerous Islamic social finance mechanisms that can be utilised for poverty alleviation and their existence is evident across Bangladesh. These cover the full spectrum of philanthropic to financing, investments and insurance built upon Sharia norms and principles. Unfortunately, the true potential of Islamic social finance is considerably constrained by the weak regulatory and policy environment. Islamic social finance does not feature in national development plans, is regulated through a patchwork framework, and operates at a negligible scale. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the existing regulatory and institutional landscape of Zakah (obligatory almsgiving), awqaf (perpetual endowments), Islamic microfinance and microtakaful (microinsurance) in Bangladesh and examines the potential and challenges for Islamic social finance to reduce poverty. Thereafter, several pertinent policy and institutional recommendations are provided to effectively modernise and advance the effectiveness of Islamic social finance institutions. The methodology employed is a mixed approach incorporating literature review, legal analysis of laws and regulation and contextual analysis and field interviews among industry stakeholders. Ultimately, while private investment and initiatives are always able to support the Islamic social finance sector, this paper focuses on the extent to which the regulatory and policy environment is a crucial enabler for widespread and sustained development impact. © 2020 Law and Development Review.},

	abstract = {Zakat in general and Zakatul Fitr in particular have been known as tools for poverty reduction in Islamic financial system. Many Qur'anic verses and prophetic traditions have explicated on the significance of Zakat. Zakatul Fitr is given prior to the congregational prayer of fasting festival (Eidul Fitr) annually. More specifically, Q87:14-15 according to 'Ibn Umar was revealed on the paramount importance of Zakatul Fitr. The scholars of four jurisprudential schools of thought have extensively discussed about collection and distribution of Zakatul Fitr. Nonetheless, with 2.5 million Muslims that performed lesser hajj in 2018 and they were all expected to give out Zakatul Fitr of 15 Saudi Riyal per head which is amounting to 37.5 million. More importantly, two days is allocated for the collection of Zakatul Fitr via recognized embassy attached to each country where money could be transferred. However, there is an insufficient academic research examining the diversification of the roles of haramayn on Zakatul Fitr beyond the domain of its collection in order to achieve the motive of which it is collected-helping the poor and the needy Muslims. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the diversification of the roles of Haramayn on Zakatul Fitr as an Islamic financial instrument in addressing poverty reduction among the Muslims. Content analysis of classical and modern literatures is used as methodology of the paper. The results show that with analogical deduction (Qiyas), the distribution of Zakatul Fitr could be diversified beyond the domain of its collection because a prominent companion of the Prophet (S.A.W.) collected Zakat in Yemen and distributed to poor and needy Muslims in Madinah. If mandatory Zakat is distributed beyond its domain of collection, then Zakatul Fitr by the performers of lesser Hajj can also be distributed to the needy and poor Muslim beyond the domain of Saudi Arabia. In conclusion, it is not arguable to posit the Zakatul fitr like other Islamic financial instruments is meant for providing comfort for the Muslims. It is therefore suggested that the collectors should put necessary mechanisms in place specifically by opening a window or an office in Haram whose primary task is to be in-charge of collection and distribution of Zakatul fitr beyond Saudi Arabia in order to respond to social demands of contemporary Muslims across the world. © Allied Business Academies.},

Waqf is generally regarded to be one of the most effective ways of expressing philanthropy for sustaining the welfare of the needy, the poor, the family, and the society. Through this philanthropic institution, wealth is transferred from private ownership to public utility. Personal assets of useful value can be endowed in waqf for the all-round services of the society; religious, social, economic, and educational sectors, under certain conditions and regultaions laid down by the Sharī'ah. Right from the time of the Holy Prophet, waqf has been benefitting people and defraying public expenses as it served as an effective means of funding mosques, graveyards, orphanages, schools, hospitals, bakeries, warehouses, mills, and numerous humanitarian or religious foundations. Similarly, this institution was successfully financing agriculture, horticulture and water resources during the previous centuries, as it was used to cater for the aged, infirm, destitute, and even animals. However, with the advent of colonialism in the Islamic world and subsequent negative transformation of Islamic culture and tradition, this strategic financial institution eventually started to turn into a shadow of its former glorious status. By adopting the narrative approach of qualitative research method, this study analyses the current administrative problems facing waqf institution in a bid to finding their lasting solutions and resuscitating its humanitarian functions. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.},

Classification is based on multiple factors including subject/specialization areas, country of origin and publications, research methodology, and yearly progress in investigations. Findings suggest that the majority of publications are in the area of general Islamic finance and follow qualitative research methodology. Malaysia and Pakistan were found to be the most significant contributors to the literature. Although the results of empirical studies are mixed, however, the majority favor resilience of IFSI to the global financial crisis (GFC). The potential role of IFSI in poverty alleviation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) has also been highlighted. Demand for IFSI with quality services exists. The literature highlights the lack of Islamic financial literacy and skepticism about Shariah compliance in practice. Need for regulatory framework and application of Islamic accounting is documented. Future research needs to focus on an objective assessment of IFSI in the light of Islamic finance objectives. Also, further investigations are needed to highlight the social role of IFSI-with a focus on CSR, zakah, waqf and microfinance. Additionally, certain specialized areas including accounting, management, and corporate governance need more attention in future researches. © 2020.},

	abstract = {Muslim societies and communities in all Islamic countries and most of the other regions of the world are having awqaf properties inherited from their ancestors. However, presently the waqf properties are passing through a trend characterized by usurpation, neglect and unproductive use. Prof Khalid Rashid in his lead paper has rightly emphasized need to protect and develop the existing awqaf and to consider certain measures which may enhance the income generation capability and administrative well-being of awqaf. Thus, a reform of the waqf system in the contemporary Islamic world is absolutely necessary. In a post-economic and financial liberalization environment at the global level, it is important to utilize awqaf for poverty reduction, capacity building and economic empowerment of Muslim communities. The waqf fund can be channeled through educational, social and cultural development. In this context, this paper discusses that in modern times, the economic dimensions of waqf institution need attention of scholars and economists to explore its potential role in economic life of Muslims. In a country like India waqf institutions have been playing a very significant role and have still great potentiality to do so in the religious, social and economic life of Muslims. However, they need to be cleansed of corruption and mismanagement. The control by government organization and the state interference sometimes pose another problem in the way of proper utilization of the awqaf properties in an effective way. © 2018, JKAU: Islamic Econ.},

	abstract = {Al-Waqf (endowment) is a form of charity in Islam. Among its special features is that it is permanent and irrevocable while its benefits also go from one generation to another. It involves the transfer of property from the original owner to the cause of Allah. It is as old as the practice of Islam. At the beginning, simple assets such as farmlands, wells and orchards were endowed. Charity, in this respect, may include building of centers for education, hospitals, public facilities and residential houses in modern time. Regrettably, the practice of al-waqf is no more as popular as it was in the past. Although, rich people among Nigerian Muslims used to donate during their lifetimes for personal or community projects. In most cases, those projects die with their death since no portion of their wealth is endowed for them. This article therefore looked into the relevance of al-waqf as takāful-ijtimā‘i (social insurance) product at present. It examined the definition, significance, conditions of validity and administration of al-waqf. The study revealed that al-waqf can bring about a positive change, meaningful development and transformation in helping the poor and the needy in the community. It suggests that al-waqf should be integrated in the takāful (insurance) practices. © 2017 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

Micro-scale traders in rural traditional market in Indonesia in general face the challenge of limited access to formal financial institution, since they are considered un-bankable. The difficulty of accessing capital from banking financial institutions becomes an obstacle to increasing the scale of their business. The situation often causes market micro-scale traders to fall into the practice of loan sharks. As an alternative, traditional market traders turn to Islamic microfinance co-op. This paper studies the case of micro-scale traders in a rural are in Central Java, in their relationship with a local Islamic Financial Cooperative (Syariah Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil) that provides financial products/services. Using qualitative approach, the findings field research conducted from 2016 until 2018 points out to the success of Islamic Financial Coop as an inclusive financial institution for the local micro-scale traders, which supports promotion of sustained economic growth and productivity, despite (or, because of) its traditional way of trust-building. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

Malaysia’s value-based intermediation strategy, initiated by the Bank Negara Malaysia is expected to move the Islamic finance industry to the next level of sustainable and long term economic development. Islamic banks are expected to not only focus on profit but also on contribution to societies through Islamic social finance. The traditional methods of Islamic social finance especially on the contribution of zakāt, waqf and ṣadaqah have been used to provide for the basic means of livelihood for the poor. Not only that, this shows that Islamic banks do not only concern on making profits but making contribution to the societies by involving in Islamic social finance through corporate social responsibility. Specifically, this study examines the impact of corporate social responsibilities particularly on the application of Islamic social finance which is zakāt contribution by Islamic banks on their financial performances namely return on assets, return on equity and operating profit. This study focuses on Islamic banks in Malaysia from 2011 to 2018. The financial information is extracted from Fitch Connect and annual reports of the respective Islamic banks which include 15 Islamic banks in Malaysia. The panel regression method was adopted to explain the three models and examine the impact of Islamic social finance on the financial performances of Islamic banks. The findings show that zakāt contribution has positive significant impact on Islamic banks’ financial performance namely operating profit.

Design/methodology/approach: This research uses quantitative methods with a measurement model of Sustainability Livelihood Impact Assessment (SLIA). Findings: The results showed that the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program had quite an impact on the increase in Mustahik Community Assets. This is seen from the increase in 5 (five) SLIA assets with a variant value of 1.09 points. The highest increase occurred in Social Assets with a variant value of 1.25. Meanwhile, the lowest increase was in Natural Assets with a variant value of 0.93 points. For Financial Assets, there was an increase in changes with a variant value of 1.19, which shows the high impact of the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program on increasing the income of mustahik families. This increase was influenced by the sale of organic fertilizer and compost processed from goat manure. The aspect of vulnerability that can affect the Tanah Datar Livestock Center is a fairly high outbreak of livestock disease which results in the death of the mother and child during childbirth.

	abstract = {Purpose: Baitul Maal wa Tamwil (BMT) is an Islamic microfinance institution created by combining the functionality of Baitul Maal and Baitul Tamwil in Indonesia. While Baitul Maal plays the role of an institution that collects funds from zakah, cash waqf, infaq and sadakah, Baitul Tamwil then distributes these funds in the form of Qardhul Hassan financing to the poor at the bottom of the economic pyramid (BOP). This study aims to explain the poverty alleviation effort by BMT regarding its role in providing Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP and provide practical suggestions to maximize the outreach performance of the BMT. Design/methodology/approach: In this methodology, the study adopts the qualitative analysis of reviewing the literature and interviewing the BMT staff in Jakarta, Makassar and Nusa Tenggara Barat areas to present the views of the practitioners related to the role of Baitul Maal in giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP using appreciative intelligence framework. Findings: The study finds that BMT in Indonesia needs several stage-specific structures and roles to be effective. In particular, there is a need to separate the function of Baitul Maal from Baitul Tamwil to enhance its role when giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP. The role of Baitul Maal in alleviating the poverty figure is also drawn in this study. Originality/value: The findings of this study add to the literature on Baitul Maal by enabling researchers and practitioners to appreciate the role of Baitul Maal, and these findings also contribute towards enriching the knowledge in Baitul Maal and financing requirements of the poor at the BOP.

In contrast, the financial crisis brought out interest for Islamic finance, whose models have been increasingly studied. Today, the real challenge lies in evaluating the impact of microfinance in a complex environment, where both Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions exist and address evolving clients in constant interaction. New methods and models are therefore needed in order to test the efficacy and assess the impact of introducing Islamic microfinance products, compared to the conventional system. In this context, this paper proposes an approach to build an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework, which is aiming to test the effects of such products implementation using Islamic interest-free group loans. It also helps assess the impact of the behavioral biases as well as agents' interactions within the repayment process. © 2018 Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi.},

	abstract = {Zakat is one of the pillars in Islam. It is the portion of a man’s wealth designed for the poor. It is deemed to empower eight specific groups in society, i.e. the poor, the needy, those in debt, those in the wayfarer, the sympathizers, those in the cause of God, those in bondage and the fund administrators. The main goal of Zakat is to alleviate poverty through assistance to the poor and the needy and to achieve socioeconomic justice by closing the gap between the poor and the rich in the society. This paper focuses on the effect of Zakat on employment namely the effect of subsidising education of individuals who fulfil the criteria to be recipients of Zakat, thought taxing rich workers who are above Nisab, on employment. We also compare this Islamic policy (zakat) with the conventional one (namely subsidising education of all individuals by taxing their wages) used by most of countries and evaluates the effectiveness of both fiscal systems in reducing unemployment. We develop a theoretical neoclassic model showing that the conventional fiscal policy does not affect employment, which may justify the persistence of high unemployment rates observed in many developed and developing countries despite the massive public resources devoted to the education sector in these countries. The model proves that the Islamic fiscal policy will reduce unemployment. © 2020 Asma Raies.

	abstract = {Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFIs) – such as Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT - with cooperative legal entities), established in Indonesia as part of the shariah-compliant financial industry sector (part of the halal sector) – need to maintain their sustainability in order to encourage poverty alleviation and economic growth. In observing the sustainability of BMT, there has been relatively little research involving aspects of the quality of the human resources that carry out internal activities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to create a model that is useful for predicting the sustainability of IMFIs, especially BMT, based on variables that are considered important, namely financing growth, Islamic human capital, fraud and Islamic leadership. The model was analysed using multiple regression analysis based on the stepwise method. The primary data (cross-sectional) were obtained in 2019 using questionnaires completed by 105 respondents comprising the administrators and managers of BMTs in Semarang and Pekalongan, Central Java, Indonesia. We found that only two variables have a significant influence on the sustainability of IMFIs: financing growth and Islamic human capital. Practitioners can apply the results of the study to improve the performance of Islamic microfinance, especially BMT, through the distribution of funding in the context of economic improvement (especially micro-enterprise), spiritual strengthening for human resources, risk prevention and appropriate leadership criteria. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {Among the matters requiring attention is the method of distributing funds collected from zakat to those who deserve and are entitled to receive them. Zakat collected each year should be distributed through a comprehensive process which can ensure that the zakat is properly distributed. Many issues had been highlighted to the Mufti and the Terengganu Fatwa Committee on the process of distribution according to Islamic law. Therefore it would appear that an empirical study on fatwas in relation to the method of distributing the zakat collection in Terengganu should be done to see the appropriateness and relevance of the fatwa in managing zakat distribution. In addition, a fatwa that meets the current needs and public interest is very much needed as it is one of the critical instruments in the Muslim community's economic development and growth. However, are the existing fatwas on distribution of zakat collections able to resolve the many issues faced by society and state in order to ensure that those who qualify to receive them will indeed receive their rightful dues? Hence, it is the main objective of this article to analyze fatwas on management of zakat collections for the period of 1953 to 2005. The principle methods used in this study were a field study and analysis of existing literature. Information received had been studied and analyzed qualitatively. Generally, the analysis is able to view the fatwa determination and its relevance in the process of distributing zakat collections in Terengganu. The results of the study have shown that the practice of issuing fatwa in distributing zakat collections in Terengganu can assist the authorities to resolve the distribution issues and is seen as fulfilling current needs and interests of the public and the government. © IAEME Publication.},

	abstract = {Background - The success of Waqf as a source of socio-economic financing in Islamic history in developing a country by providing the social and public goods to the society have been a major factor for Waqf practices to be retrieved back today. In order to exterminate the poverty, depending in Zakat alone is not enough. Waqf can be an alternative in solving the socio-economic problem of the Ummah which covers the issues such as poverty, inequality and rising cost of living as well in promoting the social wellbeing in the society. Purpose - The purpose of this article is to analyze the related literatures on Waqf for poverty alleviation and social well-being between 2006 until 2016. Research Methodology - The methodology of this article is through descriptive research based on document analysis on previous articles and literatures on Waqf between 2006 until 2016. From 365 citation found under 'Waqf' keywords which including journal articles, books and conference paper, only 289 articles that are published under journals publications consists of national and international journals were selected and had been analyzed using the Statistical Product & Service Solution (SPSS) software. This study analyzed the articles selected by looking at several variables which including the year of publication, number of authors that contributes in the publish articles, the subject area of articles, the country that study Waqf research and the type of research method associated with the use of qualitative, quantitative and mixed method that used by the researcher. Findings - The general finding of this article shows that among the Waqf issues or subject that have the highest interest among the researcher for the current 10 years are related to the issues of cash Waqf (19.4%), Waqf property (13.8%) and Waqf concept (12.5%). However issues that related to poverty and poverty alleviation (14 articles), microfinance (17 articles) and corporate Waqf (13 articles) have also gained a popularity among the researcher.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to achieve scale, efficiency and mitigate high monitoring costs, and explores the efficacy of micro equity finance at the enterprise level. The study compares the economic features of the proposed framework with interest-based debt finance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mathematical model to highlight the problem of agency costs including adverse selection and moral hazard. Findings: Debt finance requires frequent repayments and indebtedness for financial inclusion. Conversely, the Islamic equity modes of financing in their current baseline structure suffer from high agency costs. By using enterprise level finance and distinct entry criterion for availing Islamic debt-based and micro equity finance, Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFIs) can reach the right targets and effectively mitigate the problem of adverse selection and high monitoring costs. The study suggests a framework in which equity financing could be used to fund microenterprises that will employ poor people with related skills. Research limitations/implications: As the preferable modes of Islamic finance, i.e. Musharakah and Mudarabah, are not used by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs), empirical analysis of performance is not possible as they are rarely used. Practical implications: The study suggests a workable model that can use Islamic equity-based modes of financing to improve microfinance outreach and achieve scale. The use of equity financing will help the Islamic finance industry to move toward its egalitarian vision, and the practical implementation of the model will help in reducing poverty in the Muslim majority countries. Social implications: Muslim countries host half of global poverty, even though their share in global population is only one-fourth. Hence, there is need for solutions in achieving scale in poverty alleviation efforts. Originality/value: Using a mathematical model, the paper presents agency problems in Islamic microfinance and proposes a solution through distinct entry criterion and enterprise level micro equity finance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The target population of this study is the masakin (poor) and fuqara (hardcore poor) (Note 1) categories of the Kelantan Islamic Religious Department (MAIK) (Note 2) zakat recipients. Simple Random sampling procedure is applied to collect primary data related to zakat recipients from the poor and hardcore poor category of ten districts of Kelantan. The effects of zakat distribution on poverty are analyzed within the context of burden of poverty; specifically in terms of incidence, intensity and severity of poverty. These are examined using four major indices of poverty, which include the Headcount Index, Average Poverty Gap, Income Gap and Sen Index. Results revealed that zakat distribution reduces poverty incidence, reduces the extent of poverty and lessens the severity of poverty. Further, the current zakat distribution in Kelantan only gives a small effect on increasing the income of the poor. Hence, by locating the perfect amount of zakat distribution to eliminate poverty and to offer alternative zakat distribution model is the best way in reducing the income inequality and maximization of social welfare. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Thus, Zakat plays significant role in enhancing economic development in order 'to win' and 'to soften' the heart of the new convert to follow Islam as a way of life.

In this study, we attempt to estimate potential Zakat collection at economy wide level to explore the welfare potential of the institution of Zakat in Pakistan. We attempt to estimate economy wide Zakat collection by including heads like Zakat on agriculture produce, value of livestock, tradable inventory, currency in circulation, foreign exchange reserves, estimated gold and silver deposits and financial assets like investments in National Savings Scheme (NSS), mutual funds, stock market capitalization, pension schemes and remunerative bank deposits. Our estimates suggest that approximately Zakat collection in Pakistan could reach up to 7.25% of GDP depending upon which approach is used to institutionalize Zakat in the economy. We argue that the Zakat collectible can be adequate in effectively dealing with poverty gap funding deficit in Pakistan. We also discuss that the institution of Zakat system can also have positive effects on capital formation and economic stabilization.},

In this paper, Pakistan is chosen as a case study for two reasons: the availability and accessibility of data required for computing BNDI; and, in the past, no index such as this had been used to measure poverty in Pakistan.

The paper analyses the best practices and lessons learnt to date and explores the practical issues to implement CCT poverty reduction programmes in Muslim countries. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on the qualitative assessment drawn from CCTs implementation in Muslim countries, namely Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey. The methodology also identifies the practical issues including the use of Islamic instruments to implement CCT poverty reduction programmes. Findings - The analysis in Muslim countries suggests that CCT programmes have had a positive effect and that the costs are relatively affordable if implemented with appropriate programme designs. In many cases, there have been positive secondary effects over and above the primary goal of poverty reduction. The paper also argues that the concept of CCTs is in line with the underlying principle of Islam to eradicate poverty via cash distribution approach. Originality/value - A decade long experience in some Muslim countries demonstrates that social cash transfers (including CCTs) have a significant impact on reducing poverty and vulnerability and promoting human development. Since none of CCT programmes in Muslim countries explore and integrate the potential of Islamic instruments (Zakat, Sadaqat, Awqaf and Qard Al-Hassan), it is timely for governments, multinational development institutions and non-profit organizations to utilize these instruments to tackling poverty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The study discussed and analyzed the structured interviews conducted on factors influencing UniSZA's staff cash waqf and its possible impact on the socio-economic development of Terengganu state. The total number of 150 respondents participated in the first instrumental validation section where 150 questionnaires were distributed and collected. One hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed between February and June 2015 to the UniSZA's staff such as lecturer, senior, and junior staff in the university. The instrument was divided into four sections. Firstly, respondent's profile, (15 items). Secondly, factors influencing UniSZA's staff cash waqf contribution (15 items). Thirdly, promoting economic and human development (15 items). Fourthly, importance to the society development (15 items). The content validity of the questionnaire would be evaluated by the researchers to improve the questionnaire. The participants were selected from lecturers, administrative staff, and students to discover the breadth and extent of the needs for UniZSA's staff cash waqf contribution to the state. Waqf provides human relief, dignity, financial support, and social needs to reduce poverty in the society. The research is based on the hypothesis that UniSZA's staff cash waqf can have a positive social and economic impact in Terengganu. The objective of this study is to examine the viability of a UniSZA staff cash waqf and how cash waqf can be utilized to develop Terengganu economically and socially for the interest of the needy Muslims in Terengganu. The study applies the quantitative and qualitative method approaches throughout the discussion and analysis. Human development includes the creation of employment, micro-finance, transaction, farming, soft loans, and other lawful lucrative businesses and investments.

	abstract = {The legal structure of many Muslim endowments registered abroad has the potential in the United Kingdom to be regarded as a charitable trust. The waqf is a device that is perpetual and is governed by a process by which the mutawallis or managers administer the property. It has its origins as a family endowment that can also be held on trusts for charitable purposes in the relief of poverty, health, education, and religious benefits. As with the charitable trust, there is a public benefit requirement and the operation of the cy-près doctrine, which allows for the assets to be transferred from the original objects if circumstances alter. The view among experts is that a waqf created in another country can be regulated as a charitable institution whereby the settlor disposes of his property for charitable purposes. While under English law charities may be structured as companies, this article considers only charities specifically in the form of charitable trusts because the structure of such trusts is most compatible with that of waqfs. An argument is presented for waqfs that have been made abroad to be given charitable status in the United Kingdom for tax relief from Inheritance Tax. This can be arrived at by the process of legislation that could legally validate the instrument in English law. The outcome will be that it will be an Islamic endowment governed by English law and regulated by the Charity Commission of England and Wales.},

Muslim intellectuals suggested a long-term measure involving the investment of zakat that not only complement the poor with a stream of income that is more consistent and continuous but also provide a source of income to fund overall Muslim economic development. However, Muslim intellectuals found that investment of zakat may make the payment legally vulnerable from the Shariah (Islamic law) point of view. Thus, many fatwas and views have been expressed by the Muslim intellectuals as guidelines to ensure that the investment activities conform to Shariah.

Design/methodology/approach: Being a conceptual article, an inclusive IFP framework is described, analyzed and developed by integrating modern notions of financial inclusion, financial planning and financial literacy with the concepts of zakat and awqaf. Findings: Using the notion of a hierarchy of needs and a financial planning model, an inclusive IFP framework that can be used by the poor is outlined. The complementary role of the non-poor households who provide funds for zakat and awqaf is also identified. Research limitations/implications: The applicability of an inclusive IFP would require Islamic financial instruments and products, institutional development and existence of a social planner who can integrate zakat, awqaf and financial planning to serve the financial needs of the poor. Social implications: Application of an inclusive IFP that can mitigate poverty would necessitate integrating financial planning skills and knowledge with traditional institutions of zakat and awqaf to provide holistic financial advice and services to the poor households. Originality/value: Discussion of financial planning in financial inclusion literature is scant. The paper explores and offers a novel approach of poverty mitigation by utilizing the full spectrum of IFP that considers the financial needs and allows for the creation of a personalized financial plan for low-income households. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The role of micro enterprises (MEs) in Indonesia after the 1998 Asian crisis, especially in rural areas, was considered a safety valve in the process of national economic recovery, both in enhancing economic growth and reducing the unemployment rate. MEs have always faced difficulties in accessing loans or financing from the banking industry (conventional as well as Islamic) for a number of reasons. This study aims at evaluating several existing models of conventional and Islamic microfinance for MEs in Indonesia to find the best existing microfinance model to support sustainable rural development. The results show that the best conventional Grameen model is Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa; the best Islamic Grameen model is KUBE Sejahtera No. 21; the best conventional rural bank model is BKK Purwodadi; the best Islamic rural bank model is Amanah Ummah; the best conventional micro-banking unit model is BRI Unit; and the best Islamic micro-banking unit model is BSM Warung Mikro. The overall best micro finance institutions (MFIs) are Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa (cGrameen), BRI Unit (cMBU) and UGT (BMT). Moreover, the best financing program is offered by KUBE (iGrameen), the best social-development program is provided by KUBE (iGrameen), the best MFI performance is by Amanah Ummah (Islamic Rural Bank) and the best outreach is carried out by BRI Unit (cMBU). The most important sustainability criteria are: (1) Aid Independence (MFI Performance); (2) Coverage (Outreach); (3) Savings Program (Social Development Program); (4) Profitability (MFI Performance); (5) Risk Mitigation (Financing Program); (6) Social Services (Social Development Program); (7) Pick-Up Service (Financing Program); and (8) Average Financing (Outreach). Finally, the Cooperative-BMT model, which is operated more as a social business institution, is the most balanced sustainable model. © 2014, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Although the South is not considered as the poorest region, the figures have been misleading due to the rich tourism provinces within the region. Among the policies the Government has implemented to favor Muslims in the region, Zakat (Islamic alms giving) will be used as a means to solve poverty and income distribution.

The almsgiving principle aims to assist the needy and eliminate poverty in the society whilst promoting the elimination of greed and selfishness among the Muslim community. The government also holds the responsibility of creating a zakat institution to ensure effective management of the zakat distribution and management. However, due to the growing number of working Muslims and various sources of zakat providers to be managed, this creates an overwhelming amount of information to be carefully managed by the zakat institution and its appointed zakat fund trustee. There exist and information gap when the public demands the zakat institutions to have better transparency in the distribution of zakat especially when various issues are identified with the validity of the zakat information. Hence, there is a need for the zakat institution to have better information security mechanism between the zakat institution and the zakat fund trustee offices. This study proposes an information security governance model for the management of zakat information by testing the correlation between human behavior traits and security governance mechanism with goal congruence and reduction of information asymmetry. The proposed model also aims to provide the zakat institution with a more structured processes of managing the security of the information in order to provide better reporting transparency, making well-informed decisions and instill better trust from the Islamic community with regard to better zakat management and distribution. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The renaissance of Islamic finance indicates that people are increasingly concerned with the Shari'ah-complaint nature of commercial and non-commercial activities. Conventional financial institutions are immersed in elements of interest, uncertainty, and gambling, all of which are forbidden in Quran and Sunnah. Shari'ah-complaint finance is thus at the core of Islamic financial institutions; it is the distinguishing factor between Islamic and conventional finance. With due diligence, international organisations such as the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) have formulated a Shari'ah governance framework; Malaysia is thus positioned at the centre of the global Islamic finance and takaful industries. The Shari'ah governance framework monitors Islamic financial institutions with regards to their functioning within the framework of the Shari'ah. Current research on Shari'ah governance mainly focuses on financial practices within profit-oriented organisations (i.e. Islamic banks, takaful, and Islamic capital markets). There is limited research on governance practices within non-profit organisations, especially in Waqf (Islamic endowment) institutions. The practice of Waqf is encouraged in Islam, and the establishment of the Prophet's mosque in Madinah set the precedent for such deeds. Waqf can play a significant role in improving a country's economy and in uplifting the living standards of Muslims. However, the effectiveness of the management of Waqf assets has deteriorated over time due to several factors. Two of the major factors for this are lack of Shari'ah governance guidelines and lack of a framework for Waqf institutions. This paper proposes to introduce Shari'ah-based governance for Waqf institutions with the expectation that the proposed governance system will structure the management of Waqf assets so as to comply with Shari'ah requirements related to Waqf assets, and to foster accountability and transparency in practices and disclosures.

	abstract = {The last few years have witnessed the revitalisation of waqf institutions around the world. There is a growing awareness concerning the need for waqf revival in order to create a better society. The Muslim communities have realized that waqf possesses the potential to be an effective system for poverty eradication. Along with the revival of this historic institution, there is a call for greater accountability of the trustee in managing waqf. Despite the unprecedented call for accountability of waqf institutions, studies regarding waqf accountability are limited. Few attempts actually have been made to address accountability issue in waqf. However, most of the previous studies only focused on accounting. In fact, accountability is broader than that. This paper, therefore, aims to seek evidence as to how accountability in awqaf should be practised. In so doing, this paper explores and reviews the existing studies on waqf, particularly how accountability had been practised in the history of waqf.},

This paper also discusses the governance of waqf management as a source of funds for Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach - This research uses content analysis method to examine various literatures that discuss the concept and management of waqf. Findings - The characteristics of cash waqf such as permanence, irrevocability and perpetuity differentiate waqf from other type of donations. Therefore, cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance needs to be sustainable. Good corporate governance is vital to ensure the sustainability. As the donors of cash waqf do not aim to make financial profit, waqf-based Islamic MFIs will be able to provide low-cost capital to the poor entrepreneurs. Furthermore, to ensure the perpetuity of the waqf, it is suggested that only revenue from the waqf property should be used for microfinance fund. Social implications - The cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance will help the micro entrepreneurs to get low-cost capital without collateral. At the same time, public can donate any amount they afford to contribute to cash waqf. Originality/value - The creation of a cash waqf-based Islamic MFI must observe the issues of agency conflicts and the right of stakeholders to a transparent management.

	abstract = {Poverty is considered one of the basic problems confronted by the developing and underdeveloped countries of the world including Muslim majority countries like Pakistan. During the last two decades, microfinance institutions have been rapidly established all around the world on the premise that they can alleviate poverty. These institutions open new horizons of economic development. But majority of Muslim populace yearn for Islamic products over conventional microfinance products on account of religious injunctions against paying interest. This paper attempts to analyze the multilevel impact of Islamic microfinance on two Pakistani cities (Multan and Lahore) poor population. This has three dimensions at (i) household level, (ii) enterprise level and (iii) religious, social & ethical levels. Primary data has been collected from the program participants of microfinance institutions in Pakistan, Akhuwat and Wasil Foundations, by employing cross-sectional design with stratified random sampling method. Pearson's Chi-Square ?2, Yates Continuity Correction, Cramer's V (f) and Odds Ratio are used to quantify the difference between established clients (more than one year) and new clients (less than one year). The results of the study support the wide literature on a belief that microfinance can significantly improve the socio-economic and religious status of the participants.},

	abstract = {The permanent nature of waqf results in the accumulation of waqf properties that are devoted to provide capital asset that produce a flow of revenues to serve its objectives. In Malaysia, tremendous potential waqf property (land) is available that could generate a steady stream of income and contribute to the development of Muslim's economy if it has been managed and invested properly. However, most of that are not given proper attention, resulting in a vast amount of these properties do not yield their greatest benefits to the economy and society. One of the major reasons highlighted by most of State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs) in Malaysia was due to insufficient fund and professional to develop those properties. Responding to this issue, corporate waqf model is seen to be the best instrument to develop waqf properties in Malaysia. Thus the study is attempts to discuss on the establishment of corporate waqf model in the in Malaysia which looking at three (3) particular states which are: Federal Territory, Selangor and Johor. The study is using a content analysis method where the selected established model will be analyzed and a comparative analysis also took place in the research method. Then the finding from an analysis also concludes that all established corporate waqf model in Malaysia shown a positive impact towards the development of economy and society however there is still a few elements to be improved which includes the concept, structure, outcome and output from the project developmental process in order to ensure the corporate waqf model will positively contribute to the economy and society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to propose and verify a structured model for Islamic micro-finance in Bangladesh. The Islamic micro-investment model (IMIM) aims to harness the role of the Waqf/philanthropic sector to empower micro-entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers use the survey technique to investigate the micro-entrepreneurs’ intention to adopt the model. A total of 400 questionnaires are distributed with 207 responses being returned (51.75 per cent). In this study, a structural model is tested to examine the relationship of the behavioural intention to adopt Islamic micro-investment with the attitude towards behaviour, subjective norm, normative belief and behavioural belief. Findings: The findings of the research show that, overall, the model fits the data and can be used to advance Islamic micro-finance in Bangladesh. However, out of the four hypotheses tested, only two are accepted vis-à-vis the influence of behavioural belief and normative belief on attitude and subjective norm, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The research suggests the need for an awareness programme on Islamic micro-finance and the role of Waqf in the economic empowerment of the populace. Practical implications: The IMIM aims to harness the role of the Waqf/philanthropic sector to empower micro-entrepreneurs. Social implications: The model of Islamic micro-finance may empower poor micro-entrepreneurs and harnesses the potential of Waqf for socio-economic development, thereby, among others, reducing the cost of capital. Originality/value: Only a few studies have been conducted on micro-finance from an Islamic perspective in Bangladesh. The IMIM, which has been developed by Muhammad (2012) and tested in Nigeria, is the first to be validated through an empirical study in Bangladesh. Thus, testing the viability of IMIM in the Bangladesh context will certainly add value for the clients, institutions and policymakers in Islamic micro-finance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The data were obtained through secondary sources and 14 zakat institutions were selected as a sample. The result of the study shows that the governance of zakat institution was not reached at optimum level where there is a significant surplus of non-distributed zakat funds and less innovation have been done to improve its collection and distribution. The study establishes the need for zakat institutions to improve their governance aspect in term of the performance and innovation towards the collection and distribution of the fund. © Serials Publications Pvt.

	abstract = {This paper offers a model for a cash waqf bank, called a tazkiah bank―based on crowdfunding, endowment, and the global mobilisation of business through savings and investments―that reinforces societal values and stimulates civil society at the grassroots level. A tazkiah bank is defined as an independent institution that collects funds from donors or endowment contributors (whether institutions or individuals), then routes them to viable, productive, for-profit investments that contribute to economic development and encourage social responsibility. Web-based technology related to social networking would play a key role in the development of tazkiah banks as they would take advantage of feedback and readily available knowledge from various communities in order to gain diverse information that determines which or how projects receive funding and the size of the funds needed. This model aims to promote sustainable economic development by incorporating features that can overcome the shortcomings of traditional Islamic banks and endowment institutions. The success of the tazkiah bank model requires long-term strategies. This paper seeks to explore alternatives by applying Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) methodology to this model in order to delve beneath the superficial signs of issues to explore underpinning systems, structures, and worldviews. To do so, it moves through the four levels of CLA from the most visible (the empirical litany) to the least visible (the realm of myths and metaphors). © 2015, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to develop an integrated waqf-based Islamic microfinance (IsMF) for poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been constrained by the high cost of funds, high interest rate charges and poor human resource quality of the recipients. Islamic MFIs have recently evolved with the hope of overcoming these financial, ethical and human capital deficiencies faced by the conventional financial institutions. Moreover, a good number of integrated models have been proposed to enhance the role played by Islamic MFIs. Most of these models, however, lack empirical justifications. Design/methodology/approach – The research uses survey techniques. A total of 381 respondents were included in the survey. The integrated waqf-based Islamic microfinance model (IWIMM) was earlier on developed using literature and intellectual discussions. There are six constructs presenting the IWIMM, namely, waqf resources, IsMF, takaful, project financing, human resource development and poverty alleviation. In the survey instrument, 45 items represent the six constructs, but only 26 items have been retained after factor analysis. Structural equation modelling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. Findings – The results show that there are significant relationships between IsMF and takaful, waqf resources and human resource development, takaful and human resource development, IsMF and human resource development and, waqf resources and project financing. The results also indicate that poverty alleviation is possible through the integration of these constructs. Research limitations/implications – Though the paper has studied conventional and Islamic MFIs in Bangladesh, one of the populated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries and also where poverty incidence is high, further studies need to be conducted in other OIC member countries to adopt the model in line with practical and regulatory environment of those countries. Similarly, the study is based on the perception of the respondents, which limits the generalization of the result. Practical implications – The paper proposed a model that has the potential of being applied for poverty alleviation programmes in most of the OIC member states. Originality/value – The present paper has developed an IWIMM for poverty reduction. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the contribution that this endowment fund makes towards a comprehensive scheme of economic development, namely, in terms of the economic, spiritual and social welfare of the Muslim community in Penang. The primary source of data was obtained through interviews conducted by the researcher with the Manager of the Waqf Fund Scheme, the Head of Administration and Finance Section and the Account Executive of MAINPP. The researcher also interviewed respondents from four institutions that were beneficiaries of the Waqf Fund Scheme. Findings: The findings of this research show that the endowment fund scheme plays an important role in the economic development of the Muslim community in Penang. The Waqf Fund Scheme contributes by way of providing a financing facility towards the acquisition of waqf assets or through cash support channelled to associations or committees of a masjid.

This study was motivated by the monthly official zakat distribution towards asnaf Muallaf that did not differentiate the true urban-rural cost of living differences. Differences in urban and rural poverty lines that did not reflect the actual urban-rural cost of living differences will provide a misleading picture of the distributional impact of development, which usually involves urban sector expansion. In a dualistic economy, one of the ways the poor benefit from development is through expansion of job opportunities in the modern predominantly urban sector, in addition to increases in productivity in the traditional predominantly rural sector. Thus, this study aims to identify the dispersal of Muallaf in terms of urban-rural poverty that involved in allocation of zakat distribution. In defining poverty between urban and rural areas, therefore, one should ensure the differences in the cost of living between these two areas. The finding suggest that, a huge of amount of zakat been allocated to the development of asnaf Muallaf in the state of Selangor especially in urban area. However, most of zakat distribution on Muallaf goes to urban region which higher in cost of living without considering a set of prices including a broader bundle of goods and services representative of the purchases of consumers in different region. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.},

	abstract = {Introduction Equitable access to surgical care is necessary for improving global health. We report on the performance, financial sustainability, and policy impact of a free-of-cost multispecialty surgical delivery program in Karachi, Pakistan built upon local private philanthropy. Materials and Methods We evaluated trends in surgical service delivery, expenditures, and philanthropic donations from Indus Hospital's first 5 years of operation (2007-2012), projected these over the hospital's current expansion phase, compared these to publicly accessible records of other philanthropic hospitals providing surgical care, and documented the government's evolving policies toward this model. Results Between 2007 and 2012, Indus Hospital treated 40,012 in-patients free of cost, 33,606 (84%) of them for surgical procedures. Surgical procedures increased fivefold to 9,478 during 2011-2012 from 1,838 during 2007-2008. Bed occupancy increased to 91% from 65% over the same period. External surgical missions accounted for less than 0.5% of patients served. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of all philanthropic donations-totaling USD 26.6 million over 2007-2012-were locally generated. Zakat (obligatory annual religious alms in the Islamic faith) constituted 34% of all donations, followed by unrestricted funds (24%) and donations-in-kind (24%), buildings (12%), grants (5%), and return on investments (1%). Overall, donations received between 2007 and 2012 increased sevenfold, with Zakat increasing 12-fold. During 2013-2014, the Government of Pakistan provided land lease and annual operational grants totaling USD 9 million. Conclusions Local philanthropy can sustain and grow the provision of free, high-quality surgical care in lowincome settings, and encourage the development of hybrid government-philanthropic models of surgical care. © Socié té Internationale de Chirurgie 2014.},

	abstract = {In practice, most zakat organizations in Malaysia use the monetary approach in measuring poverty through the conventional Poverty Line Income (PLI) method, and recently the had al kifayah (HAK) approach was adopted by zakat institutions. The main aim of the present study is to present a multidimensional poverty measurement from an Islamic perspective as an alternative to the current monetary measurement. The study proposes an Islamic Poverty Index (IPI) which consists of non-monetary indicators comprising of maqasid-al shariah (objective of religion) elements, namely, religion, knowledge, physical self, offspring and wealth. The respondents of this cross-sectional study were recipients of zakat aid from Selangor Zakat Board (LZS), which has the highest zakat collection in Malaysia. The two main phases involved in the study are the development of a questionnaire as the research instrument and the data collection stage. An expert review was conducted to develop the questionnaire and the data collection was carried out through a survey aided by a structured questionnaire on selected heads of poor households using the proportionate sampling method in the state of Selangor, the most populated state (with the highest number of Muslims) in Malaysia. The results of the study revealed that there were five dimensions of IPI with thirteen indicators incorporating maqasid-al shariah principles with religion and physical self being the highest weighted dimensions, followed by knowledge, offspring and wealth. Furthermore, the determinants of each of the three dependent variables were also identified. As a summary, the proposed IP in the present study would be able to reflect the multidimensional phenomenon of poverty in a more holistic way and is expected to have an impact on zakat organizations as it gives a new perspective on measuring poverty. © 2016, Islamic Azad University.},

The term Islamic microfinance is similar to that of conventional but it is varied in terms of Shariah principles used and the prohibition of interest in business operations. Further, microfinance institutions have been established in many developing countries to solve the problem of poverty. In muslim countries, Islamic microfinance can be a powerful tool to fight poverty if these institutions are managed in the right way. Islamic finance scholars have argued that the provision of equity based financing by Islamic financial institutions will facilitate toward achieving the Islamic socio-economic objectives which include social justice, economic growth, efficiency and stability. This paper illustrates that musharakah mutanaqisah, an equity based financing instrument, is better than debt-based financing because of its flexibility and end result in the ownership of assets on the part of the customer. The paper also highlights musharakah mutanaqisah as an innovative mode of financing and should be a preferred instrument of financing by Islamic microfinance institutions. Our study provides further evidence regarding the applicability of musharakah mutanaqisah into the context of microfinance, thus closing the research gaps. Limitation and potential future work are outlined to assist future researches in the area.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the role of zakat as a mechanism for poverty eradication. Zakat is defined as 'purification' or 'growth'. Zakat enables the wealthy or rich people to purify their hearts from greed by giving a part of their wealth to the needy. The needy who receive the zakat are then able to fulfil their needs, and, thus, the economic wealth bestowed by Allah s.w.t is spread to all the people and real economic growth is achieved. Zakat, if managed effectively and efficiently, should be able to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. Each year, the annual reports of zakat institutions in Malaysia highlight the significant increase in zakat collection. Does the increase in zakat collection contribute to the alleviation of poverty in Malaysia? To find answers to this question, this paper observes the trend of zakat collection and analyses the pattern of zakat distribution. It is hoped that the outcome of this discussion will contribute to a better understanding of zakat management relative to its role as a tool for poverty eradication.},

Extant Malaysia theoretical and conceptual studies only offered remarks on the likely low levels of application of this very important variant of Waqf in Malaysia. Thus a lacuna exists to empirically assess the level of awareness and unravel the likely factors that explain such limited application of Cash Waqf in Malaysia. In an attempt to fill this gap in this study, data elicited from respondents via an adopted survey instrument was subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The results indicated that the awareness level is still low and that social culture, lack of promotion, and lack of understanding statistically and significantly explain the level of awareness and application about Cash Waqf among the respondents. Recommendations contingent on research findings were offered. Copyright © IIUM Press.},

ZISWA payer pays through an institution called amil which then collect, manage and distribute ZISWA funds to the needy. Since most Muslims pay their ZISWA directly to the needy, ZISWA instruments are not powerful enough to alleviate poverty. This paper presents determinants of individual behaviour in accomplishing ZISWA through amil institution in Bangkalan District, Madura, East Java, Indonesia. Data was collected through two stages of quantitative surveys toward 117 Muslims and analysed using structural equation model with partial least square analysis. Research found that the main determinants of Muslim behaviour in accomplishing ZISWA are external factors which are related to Muslim's beliefs in and trust on amil institution. The implication is amil should provide positive stimulus to convince Muslims to use amil services as intermediary institution for ZISWA accomplishment.

The application of Branchless banking model is expected to address the poverty problem which is significantly high in Indonesia. Indonesia is known for it's heterogeneous values in terms of its areas, ethics, traditions, customs, communities, and local wisdom. The newly introduced application of a mobile payment system is parallel to the vision, and mission upheld by the government. Currently, most literature and practices are just partial. The community model based on Islamic microfinance and Cooperatives is neglected. Therefore, this research aims to design branchless banking in terms of financial inclusion involving Islamic microfinance and Cooperatives. Furthermore, this paper also attempts to test to what extent the proposed model is viable in the current system. This study employs a qualitative approach by conducting an interview with the stakeholders and a deductive method is used to explore and design the proposed model. The finding exhibit that branchless banking based on an Islamic microfinance and a Cooperative model is more flexible and easily acceptable while crafting a deal with Indonesian. In addition, the proposed model is viable in the current system. By implementing this model, the economy can be strengthened toward national unity and a welfare state. Copyright © IIUM Press.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature on management of waqf institutions by developing a contingency framework and outlining approaches that can be followed to instigate a comprehensive performance measurement system (PMS). Design/methodology/approach - It conducts a thorough and critical review of the literature on relevant performance measurement literature of third sector organizations and waqf institutions. Findings - The findings suggest that an effective PMS is undoubtedly significant in promoting good governance and ethical management of waqf institutions. However, the current practice of performance measurement in waqf institutions is less standardized and does not cover its entire aspects of performance as a religious as well as a voluntary organization. It is also found that most waqf institutions' management and researchers primarily rely on financial reporting and economic indicators to report to the stakeholders about the performance of waqf institutions. Practical implications - The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the authors develop a contingency framework for assessing performance of waqf institutions. Second, the authors outline eight necessary steps that can serve as guidelines for waqf institutions in designing their own comprehensive PMS. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper lies in highlighting the feasibility of adopting qualitative approaches by waqf institutions. This study hopes to shed light on a standard measurement system that can be adopted by the waqf institutions to ensure efficiency and sustainability of the waqf institutions, not just in Malaysia but in the Muslim world. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It also seeks to problematise the very grounds this repositioning has been conducted on, arguing that the recent conception of zakat as philanthropic giving sidelines and downplays other, alternative understandings of it as a right. It argues that this reconceptualisation ultimately rests on a political perspective which privileges the transcendental character of obligations and supports zakat payers at the expense of the immanent presence of others to whom zakat is owed as a due. © 2014, Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.},

Waqf is an Islamic religious collected on the rich and well-to-do members of the community for distribution to the poor and the needy as well as other beneficiaries based on certain established criteria according to the Qur'an. The main aim of waqf is to protect the socio-economic welfare of the poor and the needy. The paper reviews and synthesises the relevant literature on waqf as tool of economy growth for Muslim and its efficiency. The paper then developed and proposed a conceptual model to study the efficiency waqf institutions. The paper identifies the appropriate methods to evaluate efficiency waqf institutions. Such evaluations are crucial for the Islamic financial system to function effectively in order to achieve the noble objectives of socioeconomic justice through proper distribution of wealth. This paper presents a conceptual model of efficiency of waqf institutions which would be useful for further empirical research in this area.

The fact that both share similar concerns about poverty and have comparable programmes to address it underlines the need for coordination. Departing from the idea that coordination prevents duplication and increases effectiveness, this study sets out to assess the level of coordination between zakat institutions and government and the factors determining that level of coordination. The study finds that, due to bureaucracy and lack of internal coordination, the existing level of coordination can best be described as low, and that this level of coordination has led to suboptimal outcomes. The article further analyses the relationship between zakat agencies and government and finds it to be guided by low linkages and rules set unilaterally by the government. The article ends by providing several recommendations for both types of actors to improve their relationship and mutual coordination. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Simultaneously, local zakat funds are increasingly used to pursue targets of sustainable poverty reduction, such as the empowerment of micro-entrepreneurship. This globally inspired ‘success story’ is referred to by various international observers, including development organizations, as a ‘role model’ for other countries to learn from. After illustrating what makes the Malaysian case so particularly attractive, this article develops a critique of international perceptions of this ‘success story’ by making explicit some of its underlying ambiguities. Instead of narrowly celebrating instrumental aspects of business-style organizational innovation and calling for their globalization, a deeper understanding of the discursive embeddedness of Malaysian zakat management would reveal significant normative tensions with secular humanitarian ethics and human rights law, with implications beyond the Malaysian case. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The results obtained from the computation of the ZEIN have been able to explain the effectiveness of zakat in alleviating poverty and inequality in Malaysia. Among others, the findings of the study can be used by policymakers to measure and improve the effectiveness of zakat in reducing poverty and inequality, and hence improve their quality of life.

The existence of this economic institution started since the days of Prophet (pbuh) and it became the foundation for the Islamic social security system, other than zakat, charity and etc. The growth of waqf properties is a must to ensure the perpetual benefits from waqf assets. The benefits from investment of waqf assets through infrastructure development will be achieved through two main aspects, namely; utilization of waqf infrastructure by the public and generation of profit from the waqf infrastructure. Study on development of waqf infrastructure should be made thoroughly and implemented based on authoritive evidence from Al-Quran and Al-Hadith. As part of good governance and best practices in managing waqf investment, management of risk is fundamental to the proper functioning of any institution including waqf to ensure the accountability and transparency of the management. This paper aims at exploring the major themes that constitute the basis of the discussion on the growth of waqf properties through infrastructure development. In doing this, the theoretical underpinnings and prior study relating to waqf investment and its risk management practice are examined. Guidelines from the perspective of al-Hadith are able to help developing waqf infrastructure so that its implementation can be done holistically and providing maximum impact to the growth of Muslim economy. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor among zakat recipients in southwest Nigeria. It seeks to explain the criteria and basis used in determining the most deprived among zakat recipients considering the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and modern-day situations. Design/methodology/approach - Out of 200 questionnaires that were randomly distributed among the recipients of zakat from Al-Hayat Relief Foundation and Zakat and Sadaqat Foundation in southwest Nigeria, only 150 were completed. Headcount poverty index, poverty gap index, multi-dimensional index on standard of living, income ranges and monthly per-capita household expenditures using the national workers' minimum wage as poverty threshold were adopted for analyzing the data collected. Findings - On the basis of the income range of the recipients, 128 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor, whereas on using the MMPCHE 93 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor. Both results were further classified into hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor recipients. The multi-dimensional index on standard of living was also used to capture poverty in terms of deprivation in standard of living, such as nonavailability of electricity, drinking water, cooking fuel, sanitation, flooring and assets. Research limitations/implications - A limited number of recipients were evaluated in this study, and hence it would be difficult to generalize. Also, some recipients had difficulty in answering the survey questionnaire used in this study, which reduced the amount of information derived. Thus, an in-depth interview method coupled with a survey can be used in future studies. Practical implications - The implication of this result is either that the threshold and measures adopted are not capturing the poor and the needy or that the zakat institutions are not reaching out enough to the poor and the needy eligible to receive zakat. This paper suggests the introduction of a more uniform and comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold for the poor and the needy that will continuously be examined by Shariah scholars and researchers to best engage with the modern-day situation. Social implications - This paper examines the measures of poverty and concludes on the introduction of a well-comprehensive threshold that is Shariah compliant and based on the plight of the modern-day poor and needy, which can go a long way in achieving the objectives of zakat. Originality/value - This study recommends a more comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold that will capture the multi-dimensional nature of poverty in the present day for better outreach to the most deprived needy and poor. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to identify the appropriate model to address the financial challenges in agricultural sector in Zanzibar. Since the middle of 1960, clove production has continually and significantly decreased because of some problems and challenges that include financial ones. The financial intermediaries such as banks, cooperatives and micro-enterprises provide micro-financing to the farmers with high interest rates along with collateral requirements. The numerous programmes, measures and policies adopted by the relevant parties to find out the solutions to the dwindling clove production have failed. Design/methodology/approach: The authors will review and examine several existing financial models, identify the issues and challenges of the current financial models and propose an appropriate Islamic financing model. Findings: The numerous programmes, measures and policies adopted by the relevant parties to find out the solutions to the dwindling clove production have failed. This study, therefore, proposed a Waqf-Muzara’ah-supply chain model to address the financial challenge. Partnership arrangement is also suggested in the model to mitigate the issues of high interest rates and collateral that constrains the financial ability of the farmers and their agricultural output. Originality/value: The contribution of the agricultural sector to the economic development of Zanzibar Islands is considerable. As one of the important agricultural sectors, the clove industry was the economic backbone of the government of Zanzibar. This study is believed to be a pioneering work; hence, it is the first study that investigates empirically the challenges facing the clove industry in Zanzibar. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

An indepth understanding of the management of zakat institutions is vital in order to understand the process of managing zakat funds. To date, there has been rising concern from the public on how zakat funds are distributed to the eligible recipients. The public are curious why, notwithstanding the rising amount of zakat collections, poverty rates among Muslims are still high. Thus, this paper aims to explore the problem by gathering the views of zakat recipients on the zakat distribution system. For data collection, questionnaires were distributed to selected participants in the East Coast. The results showed that most of the recipients were not fully satisfied with the management of zakat distribution, specifically with regards to the amount of zakat received and customer service. Thus, it is crucial for zakat institutions to improve their management system to earn positive reviews from the public. It is hoped that this study can assist zakat institutions in improving their management system and dispelling the negative view of them held by the public. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

Still, there are many potential mechanisms in order to make it more effective to alleviate poverty and for financing the education of the poor. On the other hand, Islamic waqf bank is a special designed financial institution in Islam. This bank will benefit the student and also their parents, due to its unique structure that could finance students' education in term of fees and cost of living. Islamic waqf bank use the concept of cash waqf in funding the education. Cash waqf is a trust fund established with money to support services for mankind's benefits in the name of Allah. The gifted capital was "transferred" to borrowers for certain period, which was then spent for all sorts of pious and social purposes inclusive for the investment objectives.

With supply chains extending throughout microfinance institution, it can be expected to be one of the solution. Though microfinance institutions (MFIs) have different organizational formats, they have to deal with daily management issues. In order to understand the operational structure of different MFIs, this paper assesses their performance by using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) from four different perspectives. The BSC provides the "balanced" and "integrative" financial and non-financial perspectives of a MFI such as internal business processes, growth and learning, financial and customer perspectives that are extremely important to create a sustainable MFI. This paper reports the results from in-depth interviews with 18 MFI managers in Bandung, Indonesia. The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of a MFI from four perspectives is identified and the relationships between the different components of BSC are also learned. Overall scores of the BSC reveals BRI to be the best MFI, BPRS as the second, followed by BPR and BMT in the third and fourth place respectively. The advantage of BRI is partly due to robust government support that makes it difficult for other smaller MFIs to compete. In contrast, BMT showed a weak institutional structure in terms of BSC's elements. It seems that BMT is not well managed according to BSC's key performance indicators. The results indicate that clients, mostly Muslim, had chose the MFI based on the best performance in daily operations and also those affordable instead of choosing a religious/Shari'ah compliant one. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.},

During this period, the methods of achievement of the goal set were: Narrow view of the legislation consisting primarily of the obliging and prohibitive norms; refusal to register the communities of believers under a vein pretext; fighting against the religious practice of the Muslims without registration; pressure of taxation; use of the administrative obstacles for registered communities, etc., many Muslims had to cross over to quasi-legal and illegal pursuit of the religious practice. The Tatar history has already had such an experience; however, during the Soviet period fighting against Islam was more successful. The core values of Islam Zakat, Hajj have disappeared. The others were transformed and started losing their sense and socio-cultural significance. The major cause of weakening of religiosity seems to be the competitiveness of the Soviet ideology in the conditions of the overall poverty during this period. © Medwell Journals, 2015.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Since the beginnings of Islam, awqāf or religious endowments have been the medium through which various public services (i.e. schools, hospitals, and mosques) have been provided to communities. Historically, endowments were both insulated from state authority and an emanation of imperial and/or state power. Modern day Muslim scholars have taken a renewed interest in waqf, particularly as Muslim societies look to revive those indigenous institutions which promote cultural sustainability. This paper examines perceptions of the role of waqf in Muslim society as evidenced in current online fatāwā and writings by Muslim scholars. These sources are drawn from English-medium, Muslim web organizations and sites which have particular appeal among Muslims living in the West. This literature propagates a historical narrative of waqf which highlights the institution's moral significance, civic identity, and economic efficiency, and plays down its pre-nineteenth-century links to state power and its potential inefficiency. According to modern day scholars, endowments, with the proper legal framework in place, can promote civil society and sustainability. In a bid to examine these issues, the paper analyzes how online sources address the historical development of waqf and legal mechanisms shaping the regulation of endowments. © 2014, © 2014 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT) in reducing poverty. Design/methodology/approach – The case study approach on BMTMMUSidogiri (located at East Java Province) is taken. Two important and dominating products of BMT MMU Sidogiri (i.e. ba’i bithaman ‘ajil (BBA) and mudarabah) are examined carefully on how much they have helped the customers in reducing their poverty. The paper goes beyond data measurement using descriptive statistics, paired t-test and some poverty measurement indexes such as headcount index; poverty gap; Sen index; and Foster, Greer and Thorbecke Index to investigate the effectiveness of the BMT in reducing poverty. Findings – This paper reveals that BMT financing is effective in reducing poverty. Most of respondents can increase their income after receiving BMT financing. Products of BMT, especially BBA and mudarabah, to empower the poor in various productive businesses have been able to reduce the extent and severity of poverty. This paper also discloses some interesting and important findings related with how BMT’s work, so that it can contribute more to the knowledge enrichment, as well as the development of BMTs, in general, in realising their mission. Originality/value – The establishment of the so-called BMT in the form of an Islamic microfinance is intended initially to effectively help the poor. At present, there are around 3,874 BMTs operating around the country. Although the BMTs have been existing since more than ten years, no research has been conducted to examine their effectiveness in alleviating the poverty. This study in aimed at fulfilling this important gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to shed some light on the roles of Islamic values and principles in encouraging households to enhance their livelihood and, therefore, alleviate their poverty. Design/methodology/approach – A structured and tested socio-economic questionnaire instrument was randomly distributed to 102 randomly selected households from the state of Penang in Malaysia. Data collected were analysed using one-way ANOVA tests. Findings – The results indicated that poverty can be fought with commitment, faith and guided principles based on faith. While the self-reliance degree remains indispensable in the development progress of individuals, communities and societies, dependence on others leads to disappointment and failure. Research limitations/implications – This study has its own limitations. First, the study did not consider the gender factor in the analysis. Second, only cash transfer (role of the government) was considered in the study, although other roles such as taxation and social services are probably equally important. Third, the discussion did not pay attention to how the proposed three constructs (Micro, Meso and Macro) are related. Lastly, as proposed by an anonymous reviewer, the present study did not take in consideration how Islamic philosophy perceives the share of responsibility to the three proposed constructs. Does Islam give similar weight to each of them? Practical implications – Sadakah and Waqf should be integrated with the financial systems to halt any misuse of the financial assistance offered to the poor. Social implications – Government assistance remains indispensable through providing the necessities of comfort and well-being to the hardcore poor such as housing, health-care facilities and cash transfer. Originality/value – This study enhances the understanding of how religious adherence and Islamic values influence households’ well-being and paves the way for further research on this crucial issue. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Financial inclusion (FI) is a global movement under the world bank programs and Alliance Financial Inclusion (AFI) which is sponsored by the Bill Gates Foundation. The aim of the movement is to ensure that the poor is able to access any financial services. The FI level in Indonesia achieved 32 %; it means 68% are financial transactions excluding the poor, whereas, the average figure in the world is just only 50%. The poverty rate in Indonesia is very high, it is reaching approximately 59%. Hence, FI is an urgent solution for the case of Indonesia. To tackle this issue, the Indonesian government has just started adopting FI by introducing the vision, the mission, and the concept for the efforts taken. The question is to what extent the appropriate model will be applied in Indonesia. There are two models: the AFI global model or top down model and another community model based on local values. There are pros and cons to the above issue. Some proponents have suggested the Islamic microfinance cooperative, i.e., the Baitul Mal Wa Tanwil (BMT) which is the offering of a solution based on its relationship to the poor. They do not agree with the global model. This study therefore attempts to evaluate the models and design the appropriate model for Indonesia which has special characteristics, i.e., cooperation, value driven culture, local wisdom, etc., which is neglected in most studies undertaken so far. This study is based on a qualitative approach done by conducting interviews of the stakeholders, using the deductive method to explore and design the model. This research revealed that the financial inclusion model based on Baitul Mal Wa Tanwil (BMT)-Cooperative is better in terms of flexibility and acceptability when compared to the global model. This is because Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world with wide distances, diverse cultures, values, customs, and religions. To deal with the distances, wide area, and efficiency issues, the ICT mobile phone should be suitably used. The implementation of the model will strengthen the unity of Indonesia and national issues.},

	abstract = {Islamic microfinance is one of the essential unconventional branch of lending that uses by Islamic microfinance providers for financial and social inclusion to provide financial support for low-income people as well as the extremely poor. Through the in-bodied social inclusion tools, Islamic microfinance can best used to mitigate the negative impact of the extreme poverty. Since financing micro-borrowers and extremely poor are highly risk, the need for efficient and effective regulatory and supervision of microfinance frame work is very important. This research investigated Sudanese Islamic microfinance regulatory and supervisory framework. Despite of the exerted efforts by Sudanese government through providing favorable climate and the establishment of Islamic financial intuitions and establishing structured microfinance framework, the results showed that Sudanese microfinance regulatory framework is not providing best outreach. Despite the continuous increasing of the ceiling portfolio by the regulatory authority until reached 12% from 4% since the first issued rules in 2006, the actually utilization is insignificant at the end of the year 2013. This might be due to several reasons such as bad basic infrastructures, ineffective follow up by the regulator of the microfinance providers, Islamic microfinance deliberately ignoring the rural areas clients’ because of the high risk, the framework lack of the building capacity tools for clients as well as for the microfinance providers staff. The results of this research gives strong policy implications for both to Islamic microfinance regulator and providers to carry on real revision and evaluation for the efficiency and effectiveness of the current operated microfinance frame work in Sudan. These results might be useful for Islamic microfinance regulators and providers in Muslims countries and interested providers in the West the benefit from the nullified factors that render the regulatory framework ineffective. © 2015 Canadian Center of Science and Education.

	abstract = {Zakat is a compulsory levy imposed on the Muslims who are relatively financially well. Zakat plays a crucial role in Islamic economy since it is one of the important economic tools to elevate the poverty. The confidence of the zakat payers on the process of zakat collection and distribution performed by the zakat institutions plays the essential role in order to collect more zakat. Public confidence can be gained by transparent and full disclosure of financial information of the institutions. Many international organizations such as AAOIFI and IFSB and local standard setting bodies like MASB have provided the accounting guidelines and standards for the transparency of the companies. The prevailing standards focus on the profit oriented institutions and to the extent of our knowledge, no guideline has been issued for the financial reporting aspect of zakat institutions. Thus, the objective of this research is to propose best practices of financial information disclosure for zakat institutions. Both primary and secondary data are used in this study. Primary data is collected from the questionnaire and secondary data is obtained from the relevant books, articles and internet resources. In addition, library research and in terms of data analysis, descriptive statistics is employed. The results from the questionnaire reveal that there is a need for the guidelines for financial information disclosure. The respondents highlight that disclosure on accounting policy and changes and board of trustees, risk management, statement of internal control, important highlights, disclosure on zakat collection and distribution and statement of cash flow are the essential components of reporting. The findings will be the interest of zakat authorities, regulators, zakat payers, zakat recipients and researchers. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.},

Although poverty alleviation strategies in Malaysia have been acclaimed success by United Nation Development Programme (UNDP, 2013), new form of poverty emerged in urban area as a result of rapid economic growth and development. Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon and different societies have different perceptions of poverty. These will led to uncertainty in determining of poverty. Most of welfare institutions in Malaysia measure poverty from the monetary perspective using monthly income or expenditure. In practice, conventional institutions such as Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat Malaysia (JKMM) use monetary approach in determining poverty through the Poverty Line Income (PLI). While, Islamic institutions adopt the monetary approach in determining poverty using Had Al-Kifayah (HAK). The objective of this paper is to explain the concept and analyze the uncertainty factors that have contributed to the incidence of poverty in urban area using PLI and HAK method. This study would highlight the similarities and differences of both the methods. A survey aided by a structured questionnaire was carried out on 300 selected households in the state of Kuala Lumpur and 150 household datasets are obtained from Department of Zakat, Islamic Center, UTM, Johor.

On the other hand Muslim countries across Asia and Africa are known or depicted as less developed and plagued by poverty. Several Malay Kingdoms throughout the Golden Chersonese together with Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo formed a new country known as Malaysia inherited some welfare policies from its former British rule. This paper intends to investigate and highlight the dimension of social welfare and social protection policy in Malaysia besides the establishment of Welfare Department during the British colonial times. It was found that the welfare concept has been part and parcel of the life of Malay people since their conversion to Islam long before the arrival of the European invaders. The welfare concept is derived from the Quran. Besides revealing the matters of faiths, the Quran also contains principles concerning relationship among human beings. Every member of society are taught and encouraged to take care the welfare of others. The act of charity towards the poor and needy has been mentioned by Allah in the Quran. This paper concluded that Malaysia as a predominantly Muslim country embraces the callings of welfare as stated in the Quran through wealth redistribution. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors have raised and tested a set of questions concerning the essence of the Islamic taxation model in relation to taxpayers' financial ethics. The main question of the research addresses key factors, which determine the advisability of introducing a special socially oriented tax with signs of zakat in the opinion of persons with low-level awareness of the Islamic tax system (the case of Russia). To challenge this question, it was considered appropriate to conduct a survey. Relevant factors were revealed by means of ordinal logit modeling. It was proved that the corresponding loyalty positively relates to the following statements: a) an individual should regularly donate a part of his income to support the socially vulnerable categories of the population; b) administrating socially oriented taxes should be the responsibility of special non-governmental organizations with publicly available and transparent reporting; c) any socially oriented expenditures should be taken into account in the personal income tax. The chances to support the abovementioned special tax are significantly higher for younger students. In summary, there is a clear interconnection between financial ethics and opportunities to implement the Islamic tax model. It should be noted that Islamic taxation, focused on personal and social responsibility of taxpayers, creates for them maximum convenience and ensures their involvement and commitment. In our opinion, these aspects need to be taken into account in the traditional tax administration. Therefore, we believe that in the question of an effective taxation, financial ethics really matters. Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management Association},

	abstract = {Islamic micro finance is a growing industry in several Muslim countries such as Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Malaysia. Islamic microfinance is at the heart of Islamic finance as it addresses one of the fundamental roles of financial intermediaries demanded by Shariah. Over the past few decades, many initiatives have taken place to alleviate poverty in Muslim countries. This paper provides the Islamic thoughts and motives behind these initiatives and then, it discusses the mechanisms proposed by Islam to improve the life of poor, prevent them to become poor, and also to improve the general economic relations among members of society. Later on, mudarabah, Musharakah, murabahah, Ijarah, and qard al-hasan are discussed as different types of Shariah compliant contracts that can be used as the base of micro financing business model. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

If zakat can be managed effectively,the collection of zakat can be maximized compared to income tax collection. Thus,this article is an early study proposing a research model to examine the factors that influence stakeholder trust in zakat institutions.

An extensive literature review method was utilized to identify and analyze the relevant literature in order to propose the model.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report that the social business model has emerged to mitigate the failure of free-market capitalism driven by self-interest in creating social value. It shows how social business contradicts with free-market capitalism while being compatible with Islamic moral economy due to the axiomatic differences between the two economic systems. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows conceptual, axiomatic and theoretical approach to show how the social business model contradicts with free-market capitalism, but is compatible with Islamic moral economy. The paper provides a theoretical framework for Islamic social business based on an Islamic human and social development perspective. The paper first discusses the failure of free-market capitalism and the emergence of social business in the capitalist system. It then defines Islamic social business and lays out its axiomatic foundation based on the Islamic worldview. It also presents Islamic financial instruments and funds for social business. Finally, it makes a case for sustainable socioeconomic development and subjective well-being within the Islamic development paradigm. Findings – The paper shows that a cosmetic change to capitalism is not sufficient for enabling the social business model to take the main stage in the free-market system. There is a need for a new paradigm of reality, truth, telos and human nature to support social business. Tawhidi paradigm can be such alternative. The paper makes a strong case for social business from an Islamic worldview. Particularly, certain economic axioms within the Tawhidi anthropology, teleology and axiology provide intrinsic causes for pursuing such business model. The multi-dimensional nature of humans from the Tawhidi anthropology sets the intrinsic foundation for social business. Indeed, although the social business model is new to the West, it has been practiced in certain forms in the Muslim world throughout history. Zakat, sadaqah, and qard hasan can be used to support social business in addition to some Islamic banking instruments. The paper suggests that Muslim countries should embrace the social business model for sustainable development and greater subjective well-being. Research limitations/implications – The paper is purely theoretical. Future studies might shed light on the issue through empirical evidence. Practical implications – The paper is likely to enhance the interest in social business in the Muslim world. Social implications – The paper has potential to lead the creation of social value through dissemination of the social business model. Originality/value – The paper contributes the Islamic moral economy doctrine by making a strong case for Islamic social business. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Adopting qualitative data collection method, an in-depth interview method is used to retrieve information on the expenditure pattern of the households and the underlying reasons for doing so. Five households with various demographic backgrounds are chosen from Mukim Laka Temin, Kubang Pasu District. This study discovers the expenditure of each poor household is managed by a woman and each household has its own unique livelihood strategies which are based on the type of jobs of the household members and the households’ spending arrangements. All households prioritize their expenditure, food as the main priority, followed utility bills, transportation, education and others. Most households constantly receive financial supports from various sources such as government agencies and individuals in terms of zakat and donation. The study suggests the livelihoods strategies adopted by the households can be translated into opportunities for the poor households to improve their socio-economic status if the members receive proper provision of trainings and capitals. © 2016, International Journal of Business and Society.

	abstract = {Microfinance is recognized as a developmental tool to fight poverty. Recent studies have shown positive impacts of the microfinance on the income and health of the clients. It has started in Bangladesh and spread to other continents of the world. However, there is agitation that microfinance has not been able to achieve its objective of fighting poverty. This is due to the shift that has taken place in the industry from poverty focused to profit oriented business. Above all, microfinance faces other challenges on its way to succeed. One of the major challenges is that the product is not universally applicable or it does not tailor with the belief system of the Muslims. Since interest (riba) is prohibited in Islam, many Muslims denounce conventional microfinance for fear of violating their religious injunctions even though many others have accepted it out of necessity. The objective of this paper is to propose a shariah compliant microfinance product in Islamic banking operations particularly in Malaysia. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to know the present structure and move of the Islamic banks of Pakistan as well as current issues and challenges for Islamic microfinance. However, this is based on perceptions of the Islamic bankers, regulators and micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders, as they are the key players in the credit market. Design/methodology/approach – The study gathered relevant information through conducting field survey. Two questionnaires were designed for the survey. One questionnaire was administered to survey 270 micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders in three major cities of Pakistan. Another survey deals with the perceptions of Islamic bankers. In total, 100 people from middle and top management were surveyed from five full-fledged Islamic banks of Pakistan. The SPSS software, version 16, was used for questionnaire reliability and descriptive analysis to analyse the data. Findings – In general, the study found the strong opinions of the respondents speak in favour of Islamic microfinance under a system of profit and loss sharing. Conversely, the majority of the clients also feel that Islamic banks do not encourage lower-income micro-entrepreneurs. In addition, the study found that Islamic microfinance is constrained by lack of knowledge, experience and professionalism of the supporting staff; however, Islamic bankers have shown great consensus that Islamic banks should offer Islamic microfinance products and instruments to respond to the needs of the poor for poverty alleviation. Research limitations/implications – The first limitation of the study is the meagre interest of micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders to participate in the survey. The second limitation of this work concerns the extremely busy schedule of top management and administrative impediment to approach and fix an appointment. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study provide insights to Islamic banks in diversifying their products by offering Islamic microfinance to the low-income entrepreneurs but with proper guidelines and policies. Practical implications – There is a need to educate the community towards the merits of Islamic banking system by developing a good information system using good visuals and professionally presented seminars, banners and arranging regular sessions with the business community. The growth and development of Islamic banking in the country largely depend on its customers’ enhanced knowledge and awareness about its products and services. Social implications – It is the responsibility of the community as well as of government to change the mindset of the poor that banks are meant to serve the interest of everybody, regardless of social, economic and political status. Originality/value – Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the area of Islamic microfinance by examining the perceptions of Islamic bankers and micro-entrepreneurs. This can help Islamic banks of Pakistan to design and formulate new administrative as well as operational procedures to serve the interest of the poor with commitment towards Islamic values. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The World Bank (2010: Poverty profile in Muslim world, from http://www.worldbank.org) estimates that approximately 3 billion people are living in poverty and 46 million more people will come under the income level of US$1.25 a day due to the recent global economic meltdown and slow economic growth rates. Thirty-five percent of these people are Muslims from Islamic countries. The global Muslim community has an essential role to play in addressing the injustice of global poverty through zakat. Zakat is an Islamic faith-based institution and is being underutilized for poverty reduction in many of these poor Muslim countries. Since zakat constitutes one of the pillars of Islam, it is logical to assume that policy makers among Muslims should pay serious attention to it. However, that is not the case for many Muslim countries and this paper will show that not all Muslim countries are seriously applying zakat in its strategy of combating poverty. This paper will specifically examine the role and effect of zakat in three Muslim countries (Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia) providing the facts of countries that practise zakat in comparison with those that do not. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.},

In spite of the efforts exerted to reduce poverty and inequality, poverty is still widespread in Sudan. This study aimed at examining from an empirical point of view, the roles of zakat and knowledge in reducing poverty in Sudan during the period (1990-2009), using data collected from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and Abdelmawla (2010). Two policy variables are incorporated in the empirical model namely, the percentage spent on poor out of total zakat funds and educational attainment (proxy for knowledge). By applying the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique, the results obtained signify that zakat and educational attainment impact significantly at the 1% level on reducing poverty in Sudan. The study recommends increasing educational attainment rates and improving the quality of education, which requires among other things, increasing expenditure on education at all levels, beside the care for adult literacy classes. In addition to that, raising the percentage spent on the poor out of total zakat funds is highly recommended to reduce inequality in the distribution of income. Income support should particularly be used for the part of the population with special needs. © 2014 Statistical Economic and Social Research. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Being dependent on the public for funding, a transparent charity organization will more likely to gain confidence from potential donors. This paper focuses on waqf institution, a religious-based of charity organization. Waqf is an Islamic endowment. Waqf can be in the form of cash, property or assets that one donates for the social benefit of the society. Diverse examples of waqf asset include religious buildings, schools, cemeteries, orphanage, commercial and residential buildings and also fund for maintenance. The provision of waqf provides the giver with eternal reward as long as the waqf continues to benefit others either directly or indirectly. The perpetual nature of waqf makes it a highly effective platform for sustainable economic growth. Though many waqf organizations are private in nature, this paper examines transparency in state-owned waqf organizations in Malaysia. Waqf organizations in Malaysia are under the purview of state authorities. Each states set up its own authority to manage waqf. The trustee of waqf in Malaysia are managed by State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs). There are fourteen SIRCs each managing their own waqf organizations. This paper examines the information available on the websites of 14 state waqf organizations in Malaysia using content analysis approach. This study examines information on financial, management and media available in the organizations websites. As for the findings, most websites only provide basic organizational information, while financial matters such as collection and usage of fund were quite limited access. Information availability varies significantly among waqf institutions. Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management Association},

This study was conducted to assess the prospects and challenges of Islamic microfinance programmes in poverty alleviation. The findings revealed an inelastic demand for Islamic microfinance products over the conventional one. In the absence of Islamic financing sources, almost all Muslim respondents were compelled to borrow from the conventional interest-based lending sources. Lack of funding and support, allegation of involvement with funding and patronising militant activities and dominance of conventional NGO-MFIs were the main barriers for Islamic microfinance programmes in Bangladesh.

A systematic study of the Qur'an, the traditions of Holy Prophet Muhammnad (peace be upon him), the conduct of righteous caliphs, and the writings of early Muslim jurists would make it clear that the poor, indigent, and destitute are given adequate importance. The early Islamic state, where necessary, made serious efforts to assist and rehabilitate the poor and the needy. One of the means of assistance and rehabilitation was zakat. The disbursement of zakat funds required that the poor should be unambiguously and convincingly separated from the non-poor. How was it done in the past? Traditions of the Prophet (the sunnah) throw sufficient light on this issue. When we carefully go through the traditions, it would be clear that the explanatory of poverty as given by the Prophet is dynamic. It defies time and space limitations. A deeper probe of the traditions would reveal that, for all practical purpose, the Prophet has stressed on an integrated approach. His explanation is far more comprehensive, integrated, and meaningful than the one expressed today in terms of daily intake of certain minimum calories. Presentday Muslim countries should redefine their approach towards the definition and measurement of poverty to reflect the essence of Islamic shariah.},

	abstract = {Poverty is the central problem to sustainable human development. While Islamic microfinance has been recognized as the best-fit alternative to conventional Microcredit which promises the same benefits based on Shariah. As the Islam provides the complete code of life, the religion covers poverty reduction as one of the premier agendas. Islam considers that poverty induces other indecent acts; therefore, poverty should be treated with much care. However, the Shari'ah encourages savings and investment rather than excessive consumer debt. Some of the most significant obstacles facing Islamic Micro Finance (IMFIs) lie in the rising costs, where the needs for implementation and follow-up to the field are greater than in conventional finance; poor awareness of systems and methods of Islamic finance among the target audience; and the execution of Islamic finance by certain authorities without having adequate knowledge in it, leading to wrong practices and loss of public confidence in Islamic finance. In addition to this, there is a scarcity of skilled personnel in the field of Islamic finance due to the lack of interest among academics in the Islamic finance in the Middle East region. Despite the prospects for microfinance, there are a number of specific challenges facing this industry under the Islamic financial systems, some of which include: There is an urgent need to build bridges between the religious institutions and the microfinance sector; the concept that there is a lack of convergence between the parties in terms of objectives; The challenge is to recognize the common grounds in human development, which will bring together these two parties; One of the challenges in addressing the sceptical perception prevalent among Muslim consumers, especially in the South Asian region, is about whether or not these products comply with the Shari'ah rules; and finally The Islamic finance industry needs to adapt and modify the range of products and operating models that are not used in accordance with the fundamental rules of Shari'ah in order to meet the needs of the poor.},

The findings are that rural poverty is severer and also chronic as compared to transitory poverty in urban centres. The main factor behind this phenomenon is the homogeneity of the rural set-up which affects the employment and wage levels adversely. On the other hand, in the urban areas, heterogeneous population with diverse occupations provides better employment and wage opportunities. Furthermore, illiteracy, landlessness, lack of ownership of dwellings, and dependency on sharecropping are the main factors accentuating rural poverty. The paper also analyses the zakat element of the safety net strategy. Contrary to the prevailing perception that zakat does not reach the actually poor, it turns out that in fact zakat has become an "identification mark" for the chronic poor. The findings of this paper have significant implications for the poverty reduction strategy of the Government of Pakistan. © The Pakistan Development Review.},

	abstract = {The cash waqf (endowment) has come into prominence in recent years since many Malaysian state Islamic religious councils and the Federal government (through a foundation) began promoting cash waqf schemes. However, unlike the Ottoman form which spent its income―derived from simple money-lending and istighlÉl (purchase and lease-back) practices―on the provision of services to meet public needs or for alms-giving, the modern cash waqf invests in low return savings or is converted through the process of istibdÉl (substitution) into low-income generating assets. This conceptual paper discusses the application of certain venture capital strategies in both the investment and spending decisions of the cash waqf. In its investment decisions, the cash waqf might utilise some of the tools employed by venture capital firms for choosing its investments and for mitigating risks. In fact, there is also a possibility for the cash waqf to consider certain venture capital opportunities as an alternative asset class in which to invest a portion of its corpus. In its spending decisions, the cash waqf may choose its beneficiaries in much the same way as a venture capital firm would choose its investees; that is, by putting together a portfolio of non-profit organizations (NPOs) with proven track records for delivering social results and which are seeking to grow their organizations to achieve financial sustainability. This paper therefore proposes an Enterprise Waqf Fund (EWF) model that combines the cash waqf model with relevant concepts from venture capital to enhance the dynamism of cash waqf. Policy and legal reforms are also recommended at the end of the paper that would provide an enabling environment within which the Enterprise Waqf Fund can operate. © 2012, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

The aim of this paper is to explore the factors that drive alliance formation between labour and capital in both financial and technological forms. Design/methodology/approach – An in-depth study was made of developmental interventions within the Muslim community life of a village in the Birbhum district of West Bengal province in India. Findings – Evidence shows that the strengthening of informal co-operative networks through the inputs of technology, financial, and human capital from across different sectors constitutes an essential element in forwarding sustainable development. When the focus of the development intervention is on livelihoods and Islamic welfare accrual from common (waqf) property resources, drawing on informal networks based on Islamic ethics helps to solve problems such as free-riding and the bottle-neck of networking. Orginality/value – The study shows that Islamic economic theory not only identifies circumstances in which communitarian institutions can function well, but also uncovers a dark side. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The first part of the study utilises econometric models to assess the economic performance of clients participating in the microcredit programme of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM). Several proxies are used for the economic performance variable (dependent variable), including level of earnings/income, ratio of spending to income and value of assets. The regressors (independent variables) used are education level, age, amount of loan, source of income and ownership of assets. The second part of this study concentrates on analysing the prospects of introducing Islamic microfinance products to be used in microfinance activities in Malaysia. In the first part of the study, we find that the economic performance of AIM participants is significantly determined by the amount of money borrowed from AIM. Other factors found to influence the respondents’ economic performance are education level, age, gender, assets owned before joining AIM and area of residence. Because level of education is found to contribute significantly to the economic performance of AIM participants, it is suggested that AIM work to educate its borrowers, and more specifically, to provide business training. In the second part of the study, the results show that there is a great demand for Islamic microfinance products in Malaysia. The findings of the study could serve as general guidelines for microfinance institutions in designing Islamic microfinance products for either Muslims or non-Muslim micro-entrepreneurs. © 2010, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the appropriateness of faithbased model (FBM) as a veritable policy response to the issue of poverty alleviation and actualisation of the millennium development goals (MDGs) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach – The paper combined qualitative and quantitative date to validate the appropriateness of FBM, to tackling poverty issues in Nigeria. The first section presents a brief introduction on poverty issue in Nigeria. The second section outlines the theoretical and methological approaches adopted in the paper. The third section casts a cursory look at the conceptualisation of poverty in the literature. The fourth section explores povertyeradication efforts in Nigeria. The fifth section highlights the failure of previous poverty reduction strategies (PRS) in Nigeria. The sixth section presents a background to MDGs. The seventh section showcases application of Islamic economics models (faithbased model and business system model (BSM)) to MDGs. The eighth section is devoted to data projections, analysis and interpretation. The final section concludes with policy prescriptions. Findings – On the basis of projection which is hinged on Shari'ah assumptions (minimum zakatable wealth and 2.5 per cent Zakat rate), the paper shows that Zakat and Sadaqat collections from year 2009 to 2015 would amount to N357,038 billions and N31 billion, respectively. These funds would go a long way in helping to alleviate poverty and actualisation of MDGs in Nigeria. Practical implications – The faithbased poverty reduction strategy enriched by BSM as conceptualised in this study can be used to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1), achieve universal primary education (MDG 2), promote gender equality and empower women (MDG 3), reduce child mortality (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5), combat, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDGs 6), ensure environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and develop a global partnership for development (MDG 8). Originality/value – The results of this paper support the Islamic economics view that Zakat and Sadaqat are viable fiscal mechanisms for poverty alleviation where adopted. The FBM as conceptualised in this paper would therefore complement and pose a positive challenge to contemporary PRS in use in many povertyridden nations where economic indicators have justified prevalence of poverty, despite the various PRS put in place by policy makers. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

These microcredit institutions include both banking and non-banking institutions. But, in Pakistan where the majority of the population adheres to Islam as their code of life, many people are reluctant to impart the conventional micro financial institution on the religious grounds; Islam prohibits Riba in absolute terms. Present paper suggests a transforming change in the present methodologies of financing from conventional to Islamic one. The paper highlights the significance and comparative advantages of Islamic microfinance over conventional finance. Furthermore it claims that Islamic finance is a holistic, viable as well as a dynamic approach towards achieving the greater goals of development through expanding the financial inclusion of greater population. In additions, the paper makes an empirical examination the operations of an Islamic Mcrofinance NGO (GEAR) and concludes that Islamic Micro financing Institutions are doing significant contribution in capacity building of the financially excluded and marginalized segment of the society and these institutions are candles of hope and center of catharsis for these people. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

	abstract = {In our contemporary life, the Islamic waqf funds represent a great percentage of the societal wealth in a number of Islamic countries. The idea of Islamic waqf represents an important principle in the development of non-governmental sectors, which aims at the public benefit and socio-economic development. The legal meaning of waqf is the retention of a specific thing in trust and the devotion of its profit or products in charity to the poor or other good objectives, it is the permanent dedication by a Muslim of any property for any purpose recognized under the Muslim law as being religious, pious or charitable. The relationship between the waqf, architecture and urbanism is a very old and effective relationship in Islamic cities and plays an important role in achieving a good urban environment and providing user needs with a high degree of efficiency. Since the funds derived from waqf interest should be spent on maintaining historical monuments a great many have withstood the test of time, despite the passing of many years. However, nowadays waqf has become less popular among Muslim societies; waqf properties have been neglected and no longer serve the cultural needs. This paper attempts to clarify the historical relationship between waqf and architecture, in indicating how waqf plays an active role in achieving various stages of architectural theories in protecting the existence of the architecture of waqf buildings, thus achieving a proper urban environment. The role of waqf has undergone revitalization in the field of architecture through the revival of its role in various aspects of life and putting forward proposals to maintain monuments through activating waqf on public buildings. © 2011 WIT Press.},

Many studies prove that the provision of small amounts of credit to the poor is crucial in this new paradigm. However, these studies mainly focus on the conventional microfinance institutions (MFIs) which have already existed for a couple of decades. Their role in helping the poor to achieve higher income and higher standards of living has been well recognized. Currently, there are quite a few MFIs that are operating based on Islamic principles. Although a few studies have been conducted on this subject, the literature lacks a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe the Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFIs).

	abstract = {What is the function and future prospect for older and more historic neighborhoods in an atypical Islamic city? This study case from Amman, Jordan, identifies three main factors that have circumscribed the neighborhood's urban development: changes to landuse, rent-control bylaws, and processes of land succession. A survey of the ownership registry for 666 plots for the period 1946-2002 reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the processes of land succession. Such processes, based as they are on Islamic thinking about inheritance, are expected to be the most persistent factor affecting the future form and function of the neighborhood. The effect of such processes of land succession may be compared to the function observed elsewhere for waqf property in terms of contributing to the sustainability of traditional crafts and trades in old bazaars; in the case presented here, however, processes of land succession, are contributing to the creation of opportunities for development and redevelopment by freeing a sizeable percentage of available land, built or unbuilt, with the passing of every generation. Thus, in contrast to the often cited adverse effect such processes have in rural areas when leading to the fragmentation of agricultural farming areas, the same processes are here found to be conducive to urban regeneration and redevelopment. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Zakat agencies, with their charitable clinics, have recently gained strong support from both society and the government. They have, for example, tried to bring a community response to the current social economic challenges through the revitalization of the zakat and Islamic charity practice. Low-priced, accessible and free medical assistance for poorer families and small economic enterprises provided by the zakat agencies reflect the endeavours of middle class Indonesian Muslims to translate Islamic discourse on social welfare in a more concrete way. The rise of Islamic charitable clinics, whose origins and motives can partly be linked to the Islamic discourse of the welfare of the ummah [the Islamic community], is without doubt a consequence of emerging interpretations of the meaning and function of Islamic aid in contemporary Indonesian Islam.},

Using Analytical Hierarchy Process, the result shows that area of zakat-waqaf and poverty alleviation is considered as the most important area followed by monetary system including Islamic currency.

Zakat is not purely welfare-oriented that relies on the contribution of the giver but an obligation that must be carried out to qualified recipients. Therefore, it is pertinent that the management of zakat is made efficient to ensure that the rights of the recipients and the society, in general, will not be put in jeopardy. The question is then raised regarding the type of zakat distribution or programmes pertaining to the asnaf Muallaf. The objective of this article is to explore zakat distribution programmes for sustaining muallaf belief (Tauhid) and thoughts (Iman).

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential of Islamic financing schemes for microfinancing purposes. Design/methodology/approach – The paper contends that Islamic finance has an important role to contribute for furthering socioeconomic development of the poor and small (micro) entrepreneurs without charging interest (read: riba'). Findings – Islamic finance offers various ethical schemes and instruments that can be advanced and adapted for the purpose of microfinance. Comparatively, qardhul hasan, murabahah, and ijarah schemes are relatively easy to manage and will ensure the capital needs (qardhul hasan), equipments (murabahah) and leased equipments (ijarah) for potential microentrepreneurs and the poor. Participatory schemes such as mudarabah and musharakah, on the other hand, have great potentials for microfinance purposes as these schemes can satisfy the risk sharing needs of the microentrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications – The paper is only conceptual and does not aim to empirically examine the issues or theories. However, the paper will definitely be useful to develop hypotheses for future research, especially in this relatively new area of Islamic microfinance. Practical implications – The Islamic concepts of microfinance will be of interest especially to many microfinance institutions. The paper will also be a good introduction to practitioners in the microfinance sector to understand the relevance and limitations of Islamic financing schemes. Originality/value – Islamic financing schemes are argued as having moral and ethical attributes that can effectively motivate microentrepreneurs to thrive. These schemes, however, require specialized skills in managing risks inherent in the structure of the contracts. In theory, different schemes can be used for different purposes depending on the risk profile of the microentrepreneurs. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness of the role of Islamic endowments (awqaf) as viable mechanisms for financing poverty alleviation programmes and the value of the third sector in promoting public welfare. Design/methodology/approach – Secondary sources provided the main data for the study. These were supplemented with personal discussions and observations. Narrative approach was used for analysis. Findings – The lack of awareness about endowments (awqaf) is a barrier to harnessing their potentials in redressing socioeconomic inequities and enhancing the quality of life of the poor in Kano. Social implications – Scholars, merchants and civil society organizations will be awakened to the need to cooperate in employing the institution of awqaf reducing poverty through the provision of quality education, better health care and employment opportunities. Government will be made aware of the need to explore nonconventional methods in tackling poverty, recognize Islamic endowments (awqaf) as viable alternatives in financing community welfare programmes and provide all necessary policy support –legal/institutional/financial – for their smooth operation. Originality/value – The worth of this paper lies in drawing the attention of stakeholders, like policy makers, and the general public to the contemporary relevance of, and demand for, Islamic endowments (awqaf) in solving many of the socioeconomic problems excluding the poor from leading a decent life. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

However, so far little is known about its effectiveness as a tool for alleviating poverty. Presently no Islamic state seems to follow all the dictates of the Infaq system to the letter. There is, however, no doubt that the people of all the Muslim countries including Pakistan do observe certain Islamic traditions. The giving of alms and gifts to help the needy on a voluntary basis is still widely practised. This study using HIES data for 1987-88 finds that Infaq does help in poverty alleviation. Its impact particularly on the poverty gap and severity of poverty index is significant. If Zakat and Ushr are fully collected according to the letter and distributed to the deserving, we can expect to root out poverty from Pakistan. There is a comment by S.R.

Insights into the Islamic legal views regarding the allocation of zakat are important to seek whether the classical jurists had made reservations for investment of zakat when they outlined the mechanics to allocate zakat. The findings show that the classical jurists made allocations for zakat investment in their classical works though the types and scope of investment are to a certain extent limited. Furthermore, allocation of zakat for investment purposes can be made only after several fundamentals of zakat distribution are considered. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.},

Intellectual capital is a broad concept that recognizes knowledge, learning capabilities, innovativeness of the employees as well as skills of the organisation as the key ingredients in economic development, replacing tangible resources and financial capital. Intellectual capital consists of three main constructs namely human capital, relational capital and structural capital. In order to meet the objectives, survey questionnaires were distributed to employees of zakat institutions in Malaysia. The result of the study provides evidence that intellectual capital influences the performance of zakat institutions. Meanwhile, only two out of three intellectual capital constructs which are human capital and relational capital have significant positive relationships towards zakat institutions' performance. This reflects that experience, competencies and skills of human resources and knowledge embeds in the relationships with zakat recipients, zakat contributors and others such as government are considerably important in enhancing efficiency of the zakat institutions. On the other hand, the structural capital does not have any influence over zakat institutions' performance. The findings of this study offer guidelines to the managers of zakat institutions in decision making and formulating strategies relevant to the knowledge development of the organizations. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

The introduction of the concept of sustainability to the field marked hopes to overcome problems threatening heritage sites. There are general concepts guiding sustainable conservation. However, heritage specifics play important roles in achieving sustainability, and may direct the formulation of sustainable concepts to be applied. This paper is an attempt to add to the discourse of heritage sustainability by discussing buildings managed through a tradition of Islamic waqf in the World Heritage Stone Town of Zanzibar. It examines sustainability in terms of its financial, social, managerial, and environmental aspects. The relatively good survival rate of waqf buildings in the old town over several centuries suggests sustainable and transmissible genes within the tradition. Waqf was found to elaborate ways to strike a balance between heritage consumption and use, avoiding gentrification, and enabling collective urban conservation. It further suggests that sustainable conservation cannot avoid monetary sacrifices, and if it is to be sustainable in the long term it should be inherent in the heritage itself. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The paper concludes that Islamic waqf in Palestine is certainly not an invitation to the authority of the government to dominate the area of benevolent (caring, generous) activities in society but quite the opposite; from its beginning, the establishment of waqf was a clear representation of creating a third sector related to philanthropy (charities) that is kept away from both the profit-motivated behaviour of individuals and the authority-dominated action of the government and could be developed and adopted today in our society as a sustainable approach to the management of cultural heritage.},

Surprisingly poverty in West African countries is at an alarming rate. Most of its countries are categorized as underdeveloped countries with highest rate of corruption in the world. It is characterized by very weak economies and very low growth rates. There is prevalence of abject poverty as a result of poor economic managements. They have unstable national currencies which are ever losing value and the masses of their rich country live below the poverty line according to UN classification. This study therefore attempts to unravel ways to employing Islamic financial system as an alternative economic system for rapid and sustainable economic growths in West African countries. The study highlights how Islamic money culture, Islamic financial engineering and other Islamic mechanisms such as the gold payment system, Sukuk, Waqf and Zakah systems can become tools in solving the poverty-ridden conditions of West African countries and their teeming populations. Empirical evidence from Malaysian Sukuk forward rates and inflations revealed that Sukuk forward profit rates have positive effects on real economic growth and have the likelihood to keep inflation at its low.},

	abstract = {Zakat which literally means growth, extension and purification is a premium on all forms of accumulated productive wealth and on a variety of agricultural produce. In Pakistan till recent years people used to pay their zakat to the needy on self-assessed basis without involving state functionaries. Following the Sunni Muslim view that collection and disbursement of one of the functions of an Islamic state, a system to this effect was introduced for the first time in Pakistan 1980. Given the experience of one decade now, it would be useful to see as to what extent the system as practiced in Pakistan has the potential to eradicate poverty from society. The present paper is an attempt in this direction. It is drawn from an overall study of the zakat system in Pakistan based on primary data collected through a random sample survey. Section one outlines the zakat system as practiced in Pakistan followed by a brief description of the sample survey used for collection of data partly used in this paper in section two. In section three we present estimates of zakat potential of the existing zakat system and then compare the same with the actual needs of poverty eradication presented in section four. Finally, some tentative conclusions of the paper are presented in section five. The article concludes with comments by M. Anwar. -from Author},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of Zakat Institution is to ensure the poor and the needy receive assistance either in the form of financial or non-financial. This financial assistance can be in the form of monthly cash contribution for the purpose of personal consumption and business assistance. On the other hand non-financial assistance is in the form of sponsoring the needs of the zakat recipients such as food, medicine, education, business consultancy and training, and few others. The zakat institution has implemented various programs to assist the productive asnaf to start their own business. However, due to various responsibilities shouldered by Zakat Institution, the distribution has become less effective and yet to reach its full potential. Collaboration with other institution is expected to assist Zakat Institution in distributing the zakat fund to the rightful recipient in more efficient manner. Microfinance in zakat has caught the attention of the researchers lately due to the effectiveness of this program in assisting the poor to generate their own income. Nevertheless, the Zakat Institution's expertise is quite limited in executing such programs for the poor and the needy. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the conceptual approach in collaboration analysis for Zakat Institution and Microfinance Institution. Second, this paper tends to propose the collaboration model to be implemented by both institutions. Finally, this paper will also provide recommendations on proper instruments for Islamic microfinance as part of the Zakat Institution program.},

Fueled by paternalistic state welfare policies and funded by the 1970s oil boom, most countries drastically expanded access to publicly provided social services and developed extensive health, education, and social protection systems. Islamic traditions of charity (for example, Zakat) and family support networks also helped countries manage social and economic risks. As a result, social infrastructures expanded rapidly, and key social indicators-such as child mortality rates, life expectancy, and literacy-show dramatic improvements in most countries. Nevertheless, major challenges remain. Poverty is a problem, with 30 percent of the region's population living on less than $2 a day. The low-income countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) have alarming levels of infant and maternal mortality and illiteracy, with limited resources to tackle these problems. In the middle- and high-income countries, health, education, and social protection systems must concentrate on targeting vulnerable populations and ensuring equity, quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability in the provision of services. What can be done to address the problems in the health, education, and social protection systems in the region?
