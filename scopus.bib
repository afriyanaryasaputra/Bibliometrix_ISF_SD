	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to present a conceptual model on service quality of zakat institutions that are responsible for collecting, managing and distributing zakat in Malaysia. Zakat is an Islamic religious “tax” charged on the rich and well-to-do members of the community for distribution to the poor and the needy as well as other beneficiaries based on certain established criteria according to the Qur’an. The main aim of zakat is to protect the socio-economic welfare of the poor and the needy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews and synthesizes the relevant literature on service quality. The paper then proposed a conceptual model to study the service quality of zakat institutions. Findings: The paper identifies the appropriate methods to examine the extent of service quality of zakat institutions. Such evaluations are crucial for organizations like zakat institutions to function effectively to achieve the noble objectives of socio-economic justice through proper distribution of wealth. Originality/value: This paper presents a conceptual model of service quality of zakat institutions which would be useful for further empirical research in this area. The findings are not only relevant and applicable to Malaysia but also to other Muslim countries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Historically, waqf played a significant role in the Islamic economic system, particularly in rendering exemplary welfare services in the areas of healthcare, education, social welfare, environmental, and other community-based programs. However, only a few success stories in recent history have institutionally utilized the properties of waqf under proper management to achieve its substantial objectives. This study uses the literature review as basis to analyze the reasons behind the successful utilization of waqf as an effective tool to ensure social welfare services in the past, as well as how this model can be replicated by considering current contexts. This study will assist Islamic valuecentric entrepreneurs, regulatory authorities, investors, and researchers to gain an overall insight into the potentials of waqf as a tool for rendering commendable social welfare services. © 2018, Kolej University Islam Sultan Azlan Shah.},

However, none of the Muslim NGOs are able to finance their projects themselves but rely on foreign financial assistance. On the other hand, Ghanaian Muslim scholars have argued for the need to develop zakāt, the locally collected obligatory alms, into a fully-fledged welfare system. At the moment, this is not the case. On the other hand, there exists a local tradition of mutual support and tributary relations in Ghana, which is at least by some Muslims identified as being as efficient in providing social welfare. This article discusses the link between communal support and the provision of social welfare through Muslim NGOs and especially zakāt in today's Northern Ghana. © 2002 Koninklijke Brill, Leiden.},

The target population of this study is the masakin (poor) and fuqara (hardcore poor) (Note 1) categories of the Kelantan Islamic Religious Department (MAIK) (Note 2) zakat recipients. Simple Random sampling procedure is applied to collect primary data related to zakat recipients from the poor and hardcore poor category of ten districts of Kelantan. The effects of zakat distribution on poverty are analyzed within the context of burden of poverty; specifically in terms of incidence, intensity and severity of poverty. These are examined using four major indices of poverty, which include the Headcount Index, Average Poverty Gap, Income Gap and Sen Index. Results revealed that zakat distribution reduces poverty incidence, reduces the extent of poverty and lessens the severity of poverty. Further, the current zakat distribution in Kelantan only gives a small effect on increasing the income of the poor. Hence, by locating the perfect amount of zakat distribution to eliminate poverty and to offer alternative zakat distribution model is the best way in reducing the income inequality and maximization of social welfare. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for awqaf to maintain its convergence with some of the fundamental goals of the SDGs which are also congruent with the maqasid al-shariah (the higher objectives of shariah). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a desk-based research, and it adopts the qualitative research paradigm for the analysis of the available literature. Findings: This paper finds that most of the 17 developmental goals of the SDGs comfortably match with the long-term objectives of shariah and there is good scope for the stakeholders of awqaf to develop waqf-based development plan in line with the framework of SDGs. Additionally, it finds that the global awqaf enjoy sufficient financial capacity to help muslim majority countries to realise some of the most relevant and urgent maqasid-oriented SDGs in a timely manner. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this paper is limited to analyse the potential role of global awqaf in realising some of the most urgent maqasid-based development objectives in congruence with SDGs. For the purpose of maintaining the coherence in the focus of the study, this paper does not undertake any comparison between the waqf and other forms of endowments/charities in fulfilling the similar objectives. Practical implications: This paper provides a framework for maqasid-oriented waqf-based development plan followed by provision of some critical recommendations on how the global awqaf can potentially spearhead the initiative of Islamic charities in realising the maqasid-oriented SDGs among muslim majority countries. Originality/value: This paper adds original value to the available literature on the potential of waqf in the arena of development. The paper analyses the role of waqf in achieving the most urgent maqasid-based SDGs, and thus, it fills the existing gap of a systematic research on the possible collaboration of global awqaf and SDGs. © 2018 Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The cash waqf (endowment) has come into prominence in recent years since many Malaysian state Islamic religious councils and the Federal government (through a foundation) began promoting cash waqf schemes. However, unlike the Ottoman form which spent its income―derived from simple money-lending and istighlÉl (purchase and lease-back) practices―on the provision of services to meet public needs or for alms-giving, the modern cash waqf invests in low return savings or is converted through the process of istibdÉl (substitution) into low-income generating assets. This conceptual paper discusses the application of certain venture capital strategies in both the investment and spending decisions of the cash waqf. In its investment decisions, the cash waqf might utilise some of the tools employed by venture capital firms for choosing its investments and for mitigating risks. In fact, there is also a possibility for the cash waqf to consider certain venture capital opportunities as an alternative asset class in which to invest a portion of its corpus. In its spending decisions, the cash waqf may choose its beneficiaries in much the same way as a venture capital firm would choose its investees; that is, by putting together a portfolio of non-profit organizations (NPOs) with proven track records for delivering social results and which are seeking to grow their organizations to achieve financial sustainability. This paper therefore proposes an Enterprise Waqf Fund (EWF) model that combines the cash waqf model with relevant concepts from venture capital to enhance the dynamism of cash waqf. Policy and legal reforms are also recommended at the end of the paper that would provide an enabling environment within which the Enterprise Waqf Fund can operate. © 2012, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

The approaches that are taken by both of Islamic financial services industry (IFSI) and its counterpart conventional financial services industry (CFSI) are almost similar. However, a distinguished approach is introduced by the Central Bank of Malaysia towards IFSI. While Sharīʽah provides holistic objectives in comparison to SDGs, the approach of value-based intermediation (VBI) opens a new pragmatic dimension for IFSI in providing impactful and beneficial services to the public at large. The end results of VBI are placed to reach the holistic objectives of Sharīʽah and in achieving complete sustainability of IFSI. This paper investigates the approach of VBI and its proposed implementation from Sharīʽah perspective. Depending on qualitative investigation, this paper also explores the practices of Islamic banks in applying VBI through Islamic social finance and its impacts. It is found that VBI facilitates Islamic banks to provide impactful services to their customers and other innovative strategies based on Islamic social finance. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

To further eradicate poverty, the government has implemented several poverty eradication programs in cities, which include welfare assistance and house rental payment. Aid was also given from the government agencies and those in private to eradicate poverty further. Among the agencies involved in combating urban poverty is Ikhtiar Malaysia, Islamic Relief, Poverty Eradication Foundation (YBK), the Selangor Zakat Board (LZS) and so on. Thus, the role and mobilization efforts of the NGOs are significant in aiding and abetting the government to eradicate poverty in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the appropriateness of faithbased model (FBM) as a veritable policy response to the issue of poverty alleviation and actualisation of the millennium development goals (MDGs) in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach – The paper combined qualitative and quantitative date to validate the appropriateness of FBM, to tackling poverty issues in Nigeria. The first section presents a brief introduction on poverty issue in Nigeria. The second section outlines the theoretical and methological approaches adopted in the paper. The third section casts a cursory look at the conceptualisation of poverty in the literature. The fourth section explores povertyeradication efforts in Nigeria. The fifth section highlights the failure of previous poverty reduction strategies (PRS) in Nigeria. The sixth section presents a background to MDGs. The seventh section showcases application of Islamic economics models (faithbased model and business system model (BSM)) to MDGs. The eighth section is devoted to data projections, analysis and interpretation. The final section concludes with policy prescriptions. Findings – On the basis of projection which is hinged on Shari'ah assumptions (minimum zakatable wealth and 2.5 per cent Zakat rate), the paper shows that Zakat and Sadaqat collections from year 2009 to 2015 would amount to N357,038 billions and N31 billion, respectively. These funds would go a long way in helping to alleviate poverty and actualisation of MDGs in Nigeria. Practical implications – The faithbased poverty reduction strategy enriched by BSM as conceptualised in this study can be used to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1), achieve universal primary education (MDG 2), promote gender equality and empower women (MDG 3), reduce child mortality (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5), combat, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDGs 6), ensure environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and develop a global partnership for development (MDG 8). Originality/value – The results of this paper support the Islamic economics view that Zakat and Sadaqat are viable fiscal mechanisms for poverty alleviation where adopted. The FBM as conceptualised in this paper would therefore complement and pose a positive challenge to contemporary PRS in use in many povertyridden nations where economic indicators have justified prevalence of poverty, despite the various PRS put in place by policy makers. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

An analysis is done in order to compare religious giving with other fiscal policies that have redistributive impact. Results show that when people have standard preferences, Zakat (a type of Islamic religious giving) although enhances redistribution, may not be the choice in terms of total welfare. But when people are risk adverse and have a belief in the existence of an afterlife, Zakat enhances both redistribution and total welfare due to a higher steady state capital.},

Using questionnaire survey on 184 zakat payers, this study shows that perceived board management influences zakat payers' trust on zakat institutions. By contrast, perceived governmental model does not influence zakat payers' trust on zakat institutions. These findings imply that zakat institutions should focus on strengthening the efficiency of their institutions to increase the trust level among zakat payers.

	abstract = {The absence of the bottom line in not-for-profit organisations (NPO) restrains the rendering of accounts. A waqf institution is no exception. It is one of the crucial components of Islamic social finance, which eventuates in social benefits. Therefore, accountability in such faith-based institution is crucial for achieving their socio-economic impact. The relevance of waqf institutions will be examined in relation to their socio-economic impact, focusing on the impact of programs and activities using waqf funds, rather than focusing merely on expenses and outputs. This impact is particularly pertinent as, in Malaysia, waqf matters are under the jurisdiction of State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRC) in the respective region. This paper aims to develop the measurements for socio-economic impact of waqf institutions. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the appropriate measurements for input, output, outcome, impact, effectiveness, and efficiency. The lack of performance disclosure found in this study indicates the need for comprehensive performance measurements concerning socio-economic impact. This study also conducted a benchmarking analysis to examine the presentation of performance measurement at Majlis Ugama Islam Singapora (MUIS). Reviewing their annual reports promoted the practicality of such reporting. The fact that it is similar with the mandatory disclosure on financial statements, socio-economic impact is also viewed as important since the primary focus of waqf itself is for social well-being. This study therefore proposes numerous indicators for socio-economic impact, specifically for waqf. This is to garner trust among the waqf givers (waqif), to enhance accountability and promote transparency toward sustainability of waqf institutions.. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The methodology also identifies the practical issues including the use of Islamic instruments to implement CCT poverty reduction programmes. Findings - The analysis in Muslim countries suggests that CCT programmes have had a positive effect and that the costs are relatively affordable if implemented with appropriate programme designs. In many cases, there have been positive secondary effects over and above the primary goal of poverty reduction. The paper also argues that the concept of CCTs is in line with the underlying principle of Islam to eradicate poverty via cash distribution approach. Originality/value - A decade long experience in some Muslim countries demonstrates that social cash transfers (including CCTs) have a significant impact on reducing poverty and vulnerability and promoting human development.

MEs have always faced difficulties in accessing loans or financing from the banking industry (conventional as well as Islamic) for a number of reasons. This study aims at evaluating several existing models of conventional and Islamic microfinance for MEs in Indonesia to find the best existing microfinance model to support sustainable rural development. The results show that the best conventional Grameen model is Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa; the best Islamic Grameen model is KUBE Sejahtera No. 21; the best conventional rural bank model is BKK Purwodadi; the best Islamic rural bank model is Amanah Ummah; the best conventional micro-banking unit model is BRI Unit; and the best Islamic micro-banking unit model is BSM Warung Mikro. The overall best micro finance institutions (MFIs) are Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa (cGrameen), BRI Unit (cMBU) and UGT (BMT). Moreover, the best financing program is offered by KUBE (iGrameen), the best social-development program is provided by KUBE (iGrameen), the best MFI performance is by Amanah Ummah (Islamic Rural Bank) and the best outreach is carried out by BRI Unit (cMBU). The most important sustainability criteria are: (1) Aid Independence (MFI Performance); (2) Coverage (Outreach); (3) Savings Program (Social Development Program); (4) Profitability (MFI Performance); (5) Risk Mitigation (Financing Program); (6) Social Services (Social Development Program); (7) Pick-Up Service (Financing Program); and (8) Average Financing (Outreach). Finally, the Cooperative-BMT model, which is operated more as a social business institution, is the most balanced sustainable model. © 2014, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

The introduction of the concept of sustainability to the field marked hopes to overcome problems threatening heritage sites. There are general concepts guiding sustainable conservation. However, heritage specifics play important roles in achieving sustainability, and may direct the formulation of sustainable concepts to be applied. This paper is an attempt to add to the discourse of heritage sustainability by discussing buildings managed through a tradition of Islamic waqf in the World Heritage Stone Town of Zanzibar. It examines sustainability in terms of its financial, social, managerial, and environmental aspects. The relatively good survival rate of waqf buildings in the old town over several centuries suggests sustainable and transmissible genes within the tradition. Waqf was found to elaborate ways to strike a balance between heritage consumption and use, avoiding gentrification, and enabling collective urban conservation. It further suggests that sustainable conservation cannot avoid monetary sacrifices, and if it is to be sustainable in the long term it should be inherent in the heritage itself. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Results: Out of 100 patients studied, 79% had cerebral infarction and 21% had cerebral hemorrhage. Most of the patients had more than one risk factor which included: hypertension 61%, smoking 53%, sedentary habits 38%, diabetes mellitus 33%, dyslipidaemia 32%, coronary artery disease 22%, obesity 11%, alcoholism 9% and carotid artery stenosis 8%. In-hospital mortality was 7% and most of them (89%) at discharge were dependent for their daily activities. Conclusions: Hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors for stroke in this poor population and should be the main targets for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Availability of free medicines and developing stroke units can go a long way in reducing mortality and improving rehabilitation of such patients.},

Then, this study looks at four main issues, namely how the structure of the commitee, the management of such system, fund rising strategy, and people accessibility to this welfare system. In order to deal with this, it is used some frameworks namely; firstly, the welfare strategy as proposed by Spicker (1995) including economic production, redistribution, and solidarity. Secondly, the concept of welfare offered by Azmi (1991), Midgley (1997), and Zastrow (2004). This research took place in North and South Wonorejo, a village located in Magelang district, Central Java. Finding of this research shows that this scheme has operated conventionaly and has not contributed much on enhancing people welfare. There is no formal institution that organizes all element of such scheme. As the social welfare institution, this system ideally offers program, benefits and services that help people meets those social, economic, educational and health needs. However, there is no specific program for the poor people offered by the committee of the Islamic welfare scheme. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.; Studi ini berusaha mengkaji praktik system kesejahteraan dalam Islam (seperti zakat, wakaf, shadaqah, infak, hibah dan qurban) dalam hubungannya dengan masyarakat miskin di wilayah pedesaan. Kajian melihat empat persoalan utama, yakni bagaimana struktur panitia, pengelolaan sistem kesejahteraan, strategi pengumpulan dana, dan akses masyarakat terhadap sistem tersebut. Untuk menjawab persoalan ini, kajian mempergunakan kerangka kerja antara lain strategi kesejahteraan sebagaimana diusulkan Spicker (1995) termasuk produksi, redsitribusi, dan solidaritas ekonomi, dan konsep kesejahteraan sebagaimana dikemukakan Azmi (1991), Midgley (1997), dan Zastrow (2004). Kajian ini dilakukan di Desa Wonorejo Utara dan Selatan, Magelang, Jawa Tengah. Kajian ini menemukan antara lain: skema kesejahteraan masih dilakukan secara konvensional dan tidak banyak berkontribusi terhadap kesejahteraan masyarakat. Tidak ada lembaga resmi yang mengorganisir semua unsur dalam skema tersebut. Sebagai lembaga kesejahteraan sosial, sistem ini idealnya menawarkan program, manfaat dan layanan yang menolong masyarakat dalam memenuhi kebutuhan-kebutuhan ekonomi, sosial, pendidikan dan kesehatan. Namun demikian, tidak ada program khusus bagi masyarakat miskin yang ditawarkan oleh pengelola skema kesejahteraan Islam. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.},

	abstract = {The renaissance of Islamic finance indicates that people are increasingly concerned with the Shari'ah-complaint nature of commercial and non-commercial activities. Conventional financial institutions are immersed in elements of interest, uncertainty, and gambling, all of which are forbidden in Quran and Sunnah. Shari'ah-complaint finance is thus at the core of Islamic financial institutions; it is the distinguishing factor between Islamic and conventional finance. With due diligence, international organisations such as the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) have formulated a Shari'ah governance framework; Malaysia is thus positioned at the centre of the global Islamic finance and takaful industries. The Shari'ah governance framework monitors Islamic financial institutions with regards to their functioning within the framework of the Shari'ah. Current research on Shari'ah governance mainly focuses on financial practices within profit-oriented organisations (i.e. Islamic banks, takaful, and Islamic capital markets). There is limited research on governance practices within non-profit organisations, especially in Waqf (Islamic endowment) institutions. The practice of Waqf is encouraged in Islam, and the establishment of the Prophet's mosque in Madinah set the precedent for such deeds. Waqf can play a significant role in improving a country's economy and in uplifting the living standards of Muslims. However, the effectiveness of the management of Waqf assets has deteriorated over time due to several factors. Two of the major factors for this are lack of Shari'ah governance guidelines and lack of a framework for Waqf institutions. This paper proposes to introduce Shari'ah-based governance for Waqf institutions with the expectation that the proposed governance system will structure the management of Waqf assets so as to comply with Shari'ah requirements related to Waqf assets, and to foster accountability and transparency in practices and disclosures.

Researchers stress the importance of financial inclusion and highlight the significant role of financial institutions, such as banks, in promoting financial inclusion. Therefore, it is imperative to analyse the role and commitment of banks in promoting financial inclusion, especially those financial institutions (i.e., Islamic banks) which came into existence to promote socio-economic justice through redistribution of wealth in society. The study is built on the argument that Islamic banking business model is based on intangible sources i.e., Shari’ah law and such sources are exploited to create value i.e., stability, profitability and financial inclusion. The empirical analysis support the hypothesis that Islamic banks utilize various tangible and non-tangible resources to promote financial inclusion. Hence, Islamic banks are serving as the ultimate source of financial inclusion in the society. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper also discusses the governance of waqf management as a source of funds for Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach - This research uses content analysis method to examine various literatures that discuss the concept and management of waqf. Findings - The characteristics of cash waqf such as permanence, irrevocability and perpetuity differentiate waqf from other type of donations. Therefore, cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance needs to be sustainable. Good corporate governance is vital to ensure the sustainability. As the donors of cash waqf do not aim to make financial profit, waqf-based Islamic MFIs will be able to provide low-cost capital to the poor entrepreneurs. Furthermore, to ensure the perpetuity of the waqf, it is suggested that only revenue from the waqf property should be used for microfinance fund. Social implications - The cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance will help the micro entrepreneurs to get low-cost capital without collateral. At the same time, public can donate any amount they afford to contribute to cash waqf. Originality/value - The creation of a cash waqf-based Islamic MFI must observe the issues of agency conflicts and the right of stakeholders to a transparent management. This paper emphasizes the importance of good governance in managing the waqf property as a source of fund for Islamic MFIs. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper appraises the application and success of Islamic finance in the commercial exploitation of these assets. The focus then shifts to the role of shari'a law in determining and shaping the issuance of bonds and derivatives.

They are the Indonesian Waqf Board as the collector and the developer, Nazhir as the manager, and the Islamic Financial Institution as the collector. The three institutions make the cash waqf management and development ineffective and not optimal. Based on the data from the Indonesian Waqf Board, of the total potential cash waqf IDR180 Trillion, only IDR400 billion was realized.

Waqf Fund Scheme was established by the Islamic Religious Council of Penang, Majlis Agama Islam Negeri Pulau Pinang (MAINPP), in an effort to develop the economy of the Muslim community in the state. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the contribution that this endowment fund makes towards a comprehensive scheme of economic development, namely, in terms of the economic, spiritual and social welfare of the Muslim community in Penang. The primary source of data was obtained through interviews conducted by the researcher with the Manager of the Waqf Fund Scheme, the Head of Administration and Finance Section and the Account Executive of MAINPP. The researcher also interviewed respondents from four institutions that were beneficiaries of the Waqf Fund Scheme. Findings: The findings of this research show that the endowment fund scheme plays an important role in the economic development of the Muslim community in Penang. The Waqf Fund Scheme contributes by way of providing a financing facility towards the acquisition of waqf assets or through cash support channelled to associations or committees of a masjid. Research limitations/implications: This study only focuses on Waqf Fund Scheme which was established by MAINPP. Practical implications: This study is expected to contribute to the improvement of the Waqf Fund Scheme management.

	abstract = {Purpose – The Islamic social capital is characterised by a desire for moral values in production and networking which promotes opportunities for innovative interactions between sets of agents thus forwarding the Islamic ethics. The aim of this paper is to explore the factors that drive alliance formation between labour and capital in both financial and technological forms. Design/methodology/approach – An in-depth study was made of developmental interventions within the Muslim community life of a village in the Birbhum district of West Bengal province in India. Findings – Evidence shows that the strengthening of informal co-operative networks through the inputs of technology, financial, and human capital from across different sectors constitutes an essential element in forwarding sustainable development. When the focus of the development intervention is on livelihoods and Islamic welfare accrual from common (waqf) property resources, drawing on informal networks based on Islamic ethics helps to solve problems such as free-riding and the bottle-neck of networking. Orginality/value – The study shows that Islamic economic theory not only identifies circumstances in which communitarian institutions can function well, but also uncovers a dark side. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Introduction Equitable access to surgical care is necessary for improving global health. We report on the performance, financial sustainability, and policy impact of a free-of-cost multispecialty surgical delivery program in Karachi, Pakistan built upon local private philanthropy. Materials and Methods We evaluated trends in surgical service delivery, expenditures, and philanthropic donations from Indus Hospital's first 5 years of operation (2007-2012), projected these over the hospital's current expansion phase, compared these to publicly accessible records of other philanthropic hospitals providing surgical care, and documented the government's evolving policies toward this model. Results Between 2007 and 2012, Indus Hospital treated 40,012 in-patients free of cost, 33,606 (84%) of them for surgical procedures. Surgical procedures increased fivefold to 9,478 during 2011-2012 from 1,838 during 2007-2008. Bed occupancy increased to 91% from 65% over the same period. External surgical missions accounted for less than 0.5% of patients served. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of all philanthropic donations-totaling USD 26.6 million over 2007-2012-were locally generated. Zakat (obligatory annual religious alms in the Islamic faith) constituted 34% of all donations, followed by unrestricted funds (24%) and donations-in-kind (24%), buildings (12%), grants (5%), and return on investments (1%). Overall, donations received between 2007 and 2012 increased sevenfold, with Zakat increasing 12-fold. During 2013-2014, the Government of Pakistan provided land lease and annual operational grants totaling USD 9 million. Conclusions Local philanthropy can sustain and grow the provision of free, high-quality surgical care in lowincome settings, and encourage the development of hybrid government-philanthropic models of surgical care. © Socié té Internationale de Chirurgie 2014.},

	abstract = {Islam has outlined 4 important elements to achieve fruitful life in the duniya and the akhirah. A famed hadith of Rasulullah (peace be upon him) meaning "Four things that will bring joy to a person, which is (owning) a pious woman (wife), a good house (spacious), a good neighbour, and a great vehicle" (Hadith narrated by Ibnu Hibban. It is clear from this hadith that Islam emphasised ownership of a comfortable home. The polemic remains that with skyrocketing housing prices in the market, would the low and middle income groups afford housing that is safe, comfortable and secure? Realising the importance of living in a secure and safe house, this study aims at investigating the possibility of leveraging the upward trend of waqf real estate development in empowering the Muslims' economy in the country. Towards this end, the authors have conducted a study by collating primary and secondary data obtained from the Penang State Islamic Religious Council (Majlis Agama Islam Pulau Pinang) for analysis. Thus the Penang Islamic Council is the study site. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 2 waqf officials who are in charge of coordinating waqf real estate developments in Penang. Based on the study conducted, it was found that Penang State Islamic Religious Council has succeeded in enhancing value added to waqf real estate developments through the implementation of 9 housing project developments using the ijarah concept. The Penang State Islamic Religious Council has enabled the low medium income groups to stay in comfortable and safe housing by utilising such holistic and efficient waqf product developments under shariah guidelines. © 2016 The Authors.},

This consistent growth, along with the industry's proven ability to safely navigate a global recession and financial crisis while still designing innovative products, indicates its resilience and competitive edge. Hong Kong brought Islamic finance into its finance portfolio after the former Chief Executive highlighted the desire to acquire a bigger slice of the market in 2007. However, many investors, practitioners and academicians still lack a clear understanding of this new type of financing.

The productive waqf is considered as a key instrument for providing funds to actualizing its educational program. Since both productive waqf and pesantren emphasize sustainability, and since productive waqf can assist to support the process of education in pesantren, the study aims to investigate an integrated Islamic social and commercial economy model applicable in pesantren. This will ensure utilization of the combined resources of productive waqf and pesantren in promoting pesantren welfare. The study focuses on 263 operational chief, assatidz or teacher, musyrif, musyrifah or santri companion and santri or students in Pesantren in Java and Sumatra using. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) adopted to examine the relationship among the five constructs i.e., productive waqf, business unit, project financing, human resource and pesantren welfare. While the reliability and validity are established, the structural relationship between the constructs reveals that the integrated model has a strong relationship with the pesantren welfare in many ways. In relation with business unit and profitable commercial activities, human resources have its significant role to assist pesantren tries its level best to realize developed productive waqf. Specifically, the result shows all five constructs have significant impact in promoting pesantren welfare, which suggests that the model as well as the instrument should be further implemented in pesantren. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

The research was conducted through observation and in-depth research with a descriptive approach to the complexity of majority–minority relations in each town, followed by an analytical phase which addressed various factors in relation to social cohesion, values, minorities, and gender. In this article, the data from the WaVe study was coded and analyzed, mainly to explore the way Zakat is implemented in the European context and within the framework of different contextual welfare regimes using Esping-Andersen typology and Van der Ven institutional model on religious & social identity.

	abstract = {Zakat (alms-giving) is a model of revenue distribution in Islamic Law. The historical concept of zakat is an Islamic state income. Islamic government collects zakat from wealthy moslem because they are obliged to take at least 2.5 % from their wealth to be donated to the poor. The collected funds of zakat were pooled in baitul maal (state treasury funds). The State then allocates them for mustahiq zakat (the recipient of zakat). Recently, the way moslems pay zakat especially in Indonesia has turned into individual obligatory expense (separated from the state budget). They usually complete zakat payment through traditional amil (zakat collectors) or nationally-registered zakat collecting institutions. It means that zakat is not purely a part of state income. However, the release of Indonesian Law Number 23, 2011 on Zakat Management brings about the discourse of the position of zakat in Indonesian Treasury Funds. It regulates the tax regressive for zakat payment provided that there is a valid receipt from registered amil. Later, the registered amil has to send an annual financial report to Official Zakat Collecting Institution and Indonesian Department for Religious Affairs. This mechanism raises the potency of national income generated from zakat. However, the later obstacle is how to manage zakat based on the principle of accountability and to avoid zakat abuse. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

There is hardly any empirical investigation that integrated these three aspects in an effort to achieve sustainability. Thus, this research is expected to fill the gap by proposing a holistic approach for achieving IMFI sustainability. This study used survey method on 98 units of sharia cooperatives/Baitul Maal Wattamwil (BMTs) using a structured questionnaires based on Likert scale of 5 points. The previous holistic approach was developed based on the literature review and the responses of IMFI's experts. Partial least square path modeling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. The results show that financial, social and spiritual intermediation has a positively significant effect on IMFI's sustainability in Indonesia. These results also show that IMFI's sustainability problem can be overcome by applying holistic approach. The study is focused on Islamic Micro Finance Institution (IMFI). The future study is expected to observe the impact of this holistic approach on the lives of the poor and on the performance of micro-enterprises as beneficiaries of IMFI. This study is the first empirical one to examine the sustainability of IMFI using a holistic approach. It also provides new contribution to the IMFI's intermediary concept from the double bottom line-as known so far-has become a triple mission of IMFI. © 2018 Allied Academies.},

	abstract = {Sukuk Musyarakah is one of several instruments of Islamic bond investment in Malaysia, where the form of this sukuk is actually based on restructuring the conventional bond to become a Syariah compliant bond. The Syariah compliant is based on prohibition of any influence of usury, benefit or fixed return. Despite of prohibition, daily returns of sukuk are non-fixed return and in statistic, the data of sukuk returns are said to be a time series data which is dependent and autocorrelation distributed. This kind of data is a crucial problem whether in statistical and financing field. Returns of sukuk can be statistically viewed by its volatility, whether it has high volatility that describing the dramatically change of price and categorized it as risky bond or else. However, this crucial problem doesn't get serious attention among researcher compared to conventional bond. In this study, MCEWMA chart in Statistical Process Control (SPC) is mainly used to monitor autocorrelated data and its application on daily returns of securities investment data has gained widespread attention among statistician. However, this chart has always been influence by inaccurate estimation, whether on base model or its limit, due to produce large error and high of probability of signalling out-of-control process for false alarm study. To overcome this problem, a bootstrap approach used in this study, by hybridise it on MCEWMA base model to construct a new chart, i.e. Bootstrap MCEWMA (BMCEWMA) chart. The hybrid model, BMCEWMA, will be applied to daily returns of sukuk Musyarakah for Rantau Abang Capital Bhd. The performance of BMCEWMA base model showed that its more effective compare to real model, MCEWMA based on smaller error estimation, shorter the confidence interval and smaller false alarm. In other word, hybrid chart reduce the variability which shown by smaller error and false alarm. It concludes that the application of BMCEWMA is better than MCEWMA. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The essences of governance, accountability and sustainability are even more central in the Islamic charitable environment like Awqāf as it plays a unique role as a religious and social-based strategic support device to the existing economy. This paper presents empirical evidence on governance disclosure and practices of two separate Malaysian Awqāf institutions with different operational setup (corporatized vs. government platform) by using multiple research techniques comprising interviews and documentation reviews. The findings indicate that essences of governance are observable in both entities. However, huge potential for improvement still remains. Exploiting the different operational setup provides indications of measured responses and indirectly suggests the benefits of running waqf operations on a corporatized platform. The results also provide an appropriate basis for a reality check on the mutawalli's governance disclosure and practices.},

	abstract = {It is inconceivable to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level without accomplishing them locally. In the Arab region, municipalities face challenges to meet a widening gap between expenses and revenues. Securing a locally based sustainable financing model is of paramount importance. Wāqf is a value-based funding model that can offer new opportunities for sustainable financing to achieve SDGs locally. It agrees with Islamic law with the intent to promote social cohesion. The paper examines whether Wāqf, as a financing modality, is a Social Innovation (SI) model and its potential to finance development at the local level. The research method applied in this paper is qualitative. The authors compiled over 50 published articles, books, and reports covering the Wāqf and SI. The paper attempts to establish and explain linkages between Wāqf and both SI and SDGs. Content analysis using qualitative data analysis software is the research technique the researchers applied. The paper argues that Wāqf is an SI model. It can fund municipal initiatives that contribute to achieving SDGs. Results reveal linkages between Wāqf and SI and show that they contribute to sustainable development in human settlements. Besides, they both play a decisive role in fostering social equity, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Wāqf is a value-based financing model that satisfies the conditions and attributes of SI. Wāqf is an instrumental tool for financing development and supporting the attainment of SDGs in cities and municipalities. To harness the potential of Wāqf as an enabler for SDGs, organizational and business model innovation are needed to ensure transparency, accountability, and organizational learning. © 2019, Arabian Gulf University.

Design/methodology/approach - It conducts a thorough and critical review of the literature on relevant performance measurement literature of third sector organizations and waqf institutions. Findings - The findings suggest that an effective PMS is undoubtedly significant in promoting good governance and ethical management of waqf institutions. However, the current practice of performance measurement in waqf institutions is less standardized and does not cover its entire aspects of performance as a religious as well as a voluntary organization. It is also found that most waqf institutions' management and researchers primarily rely on financial reporting and economic indicators to report to the stakeholders about the performance of waqf institutions. Practical implications - The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the authors develop a contingency framework for assessing performance of waqf institutions. Second, the authors outline eight necessary steps that can serve as guidelines for waqf institutions in designing their own comprehensive PMS. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper lies in highlighting the feasibility of adopting qualitative approaches by waqf institutions. This study hopes to shed light on a standard measurement system that can be adopted by the waqf institutions to ensure efficiency and sustainability of the waqf institutions, not just in Malaysia but in the Muslim world. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It also seeks to problematise the very grounds this repositioning has been conducted on, arguing that the recent conception of zakat as philanthropic giving sidelines and downplays other, alternative understandings of it as a right. It argues that this reconceptualisation ultimately rests on a political perspective which privileges the transcendental character of obligations and supports zakat payers at the expense of the immanent presence of others to whom zakat is owed as a due. © 2014, Editors, Indonesia and the Malay World.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose cash waqf (endowment) to develop a conceptual model that can be utilised to extend microfinance for refugees. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative method is used in this research. An extensive review of the literature has been conducted. Latest literature on refugees, microfinance has been critically examined beside the current cash waqf models. Findings: Empirical studies have shown that many refugees are equipped with marketable skills and talents that can be utilised to improve their socio-economic situations. The proposed model – cash waqf refugee microfinance fund (CWRMF) – is structured to extend microfinance to potential refugee micro entrepreneurs. To address the lack of collateral, which is a requirement to gain any microfinance, CWRMF has been incorporated with a takaful unit (cooperation) by which refugees may guarantee each other. Additionally, the model has also been structured to address the challenge of sustainability of the institution that would provide microfinance. Hence, a reserve fund has also been integrated into the model. Practical implications: CWRMF represents a potential model to be implemented by humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and aid agencies to support livelihood of refugees in particular for Muslim refugees. Positive outcome is expected from the implementation of this model. This is because of the various advantages of microfinance programs not only on refugees but also on concerned NGOs, host populations and donor parties. Additionally, this paper is a set of primarily thoughts aims to open the door wider for more researchers to explore the potential of cash waqf as one of the instruments to finance refugee microenterprises and business activities. Originality/value: Recently cash waqf has been into several models for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation. This paper is proposing cash waqf as a source for a microfinance fund that can contribute in the improvement of socio-economic situations of millions of refugees around the world. © 2017, Omar Ahmad Kachkar.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to present a conceptual model on the efficiency of waqf that are responsible in collecting, managing and distributing waqf in Malaysia. Waqf is an Islamic religious collected on the rich and well-to-do members of the community for distribution to the poor and the needy as well as other beneficiaries based on certain established criteria according to the Qur'an. The main aim of waqf is to protect the socio-economic welfare of the poor and the needy. The paper reviews and synthesises the relevant literature on waqf as tool of economy growth for Muslim and its efficiency. The paper then developed and proposed a conceptual model to study the efficiency waqf institutions. The paper identifies the appropriate methods to evaluate efficiency waqf institutions. Such evaluations are crucial for the Islamic financial system to function effectively in order to achieve the noble objectives of socioeconomic justice through proper distribution of wealth. This paper presents a conceptual model of efficiency of waqf institutions which would be useful for further empirical research in this area. The findings are not only relevant and applicable to Malaysia but also to other Muslim countries. Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management Association},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor among zakat recipients in southwest Nigeria. It seeks to explain the criteria and basis used in determining the most deprived among zakat recipients considering the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and modern-day situations. Design/methodology/approach - Out of 200 questionnaires that were randomly distributed among the recipients of zakat from Al-Hayat Relief Foundation and Zakat and Sadaqat Foundation in southwest Nigeria, only 150 were completed. Headcount poverty index, poverty gap index, multi-dimensional index on standard of living, income ranges and monthly per-capita household expenditures using the national workers' minimum wage as poverty threshold were adopted for analyzing the data collected. Findings - On the basis of the income range of the recipients, 128 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor, whereas on using the MMPCHE 93 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor. Both results were further classified into hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor recipients. The multi-dimensional index on standard of living was also used to capture poverty in terms of deprivation in standard of living, such as nonavailability of electricity, drinking water, cooking fuel, sanitation, flooring and assets. Research limitations/implications - A limited number of recipients were evaluated in this study, and hence it would be difficult to generalize. Also, some recipients had difficulty in answering the survey questionnaire used in this study, which reduced the amount of information derived. Thus, an in-depth interview method coupled with a survey can be used in future studies. Practical implications - The implication of this result is either that the threshold and measures adopted are not capturing the poor and the needy or that the zakat institutions are not reaching out enough to the poor and the needy eligible to receive zakat. This paper suggests the introduction of a more uniform and comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold for the poor and the needy that will continuously be examined by Shariah scholars and researchers to best engage with the modern-day situation. Social implications - This paper examines the measures of poverty and concludes on the introduction of a well-comprehensive threshold that is Shariah compliant and based on the plight of the modern-day poor and needy, which can go a long way in achieving the objectives of zakat. Originality/value - This study recommends a more comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold that will capture the multi-dimensional nature of poverty in the present day for better outreach to the most deprived needy and poor. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The potential of using waqf as a source of funding for such practices has not been vastly explored. The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the current corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) and to examine the viability of using waqf for the purpose of CSR. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of twenty-four (24) IFIs in Malaysia for a four (4) year period from 2010 to 2013 were undertaken to provide insights on their current CSR practices. The CSR disclosure items were categorized into vital and recommended items, where the vital elements denote key activities that are essential and are to be undertaken while the recommended items refer to discretionary activities that may be carried out. Semi-structured interviews with three (3) Waqf experts were also carried out to draw their opinions about waqf. The results of the study revealed that for the vital items, the IFIs in Malaysia were focusing their CSR practices on the workplace while for the recommended items the focus was on community issues. Corporate waqf is viewed as a viable alternative that organizations can use to help address social issues of the community. However, there are critical issues that needed to be dealt with to transformed waqf practices in the country. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The establishment of zakat agencies within private companies has marked the latest trend of the practice of philanthropy in Indonesia. Corporation-based zakat collectors have become new players in the rapid growth of the Indonesia's zakat sector in the past two decades. This paper examines the following issues: what are the main forces stimulating corporations to set up zakat collectors; what kinds of religious ideas are applied to mobilize charities from Muslim workers, and how these concepts are interpreted and practiced within private companies? This paper argues that the inception of a new concept in zakat practice, such as zakat on corporate wealth, has indicated the dynamics process of Islamization of the private sector in Indonesia. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.; Tulisan ini meneliti inisiatif yang tumbuh dalam sektor swasta untuk mengatur kegiatan kesejahteraan sosial, dan menganalisa cara di mana zakat (sedekah) dipraktekkan di kalangan pengusaha Muslim.

	abstract = {What is the function and future prospect for older and more historic neighborhoods in an atypical Islamic city? This study case from Amman, Jordan, identifies three main factors that have circumscribed the neighborhood's urban development: changes to landuse, rent-control bylaws, and processes of land succession. A survey of the ownership registry for 666 plots for the period 1946-2002 reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the processes of land succession. Such processes, based as they are on Islamic thinking about inheritance, are expected to be the most persistent factor affecting the future form and function of the neighborhood. The effect of such processes of land succession may be compared to the function observed elsewhere for waqf property in terms of contributing to the sustainability of traditional crafts and trades in old bazaars; in the case presented here, however, processes of land succession, are contributing to the creation of opportunities for development and redevelopment by freeing a sizeable percentage of available land, built or unbuilt, with the passing of every generation. Thus, in contrast to the often cited adverse effect such processes have in rural areas when leading to the fragmentation of agricultural farming areas, the same processes are here found to be conducive to urban regeneration and redevelopment. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the imperative of social impact measurements in Islamic finance by exploring the growing interest of Islamic social finance and social impact. From critical review of literature, the paper finds that despite the tremendous growth of the Islamic finance industry, little is known about how Islamic finance institutions measure their social values, and how they report their social impact. The ongoing criticisms of Islamic finance failing to fulfil its “raison d’etre” and underlying objectives provides an indication of that there is a gap between its theory and practice. More focus towards developing Islamic social finance and integrating Islamic financial instruments with the mainstream social finance spectrum may help address these criticisms. In doing so, the paper posits the need to expand the definition of Islamic social finance beyond just zakāt, waqf and Islamic microfinance. Furthermore, the paper also proposes that mechanisms or frameworks for Islamic financial institutions to measure the social impact of their operations, products and services should be developed to realise the full potential of Islamic finance. This can be done through a stakeholder-based approach and assimilating frameworks of Value-Based Intermediation, Maqāṣid al-Sharīʽah, and Sustainable Development Goals. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

This paper's objective is to analyze the performance of green sukuk's price after the issuance date. During the offering period, most green sukuk was oversubscribed, which may implicate after the issuance. The method applied for this research was the descriptive method by comparing the prices' movement of green sukuk with another green bond after issuance and similar bond for benchmarking and correlation analysis. The result showed that since the condition during the offering period was oversubscribed, it does not necessarily correlate to the performance after issuance period of green sukuk. The decrease of Indonesian green sukuk prices are caused by macroeconomic factors hence the good image of green activities does not always attract investors directly. Climate change issues may not be the first consideration since investors may only seek for profit motive. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Since the beginnings of Islam, awqāf or religious endowments have been the medium through which various public services (i.e. schools, hospitals, and mosques) have been provided to communities. Historically, endowments were both insulated from state authority and an emanation of imperial and/or state power. Modern day Muslim scholars have taken a renewed interest in waqf, particularly as Muslim societies look to revive those indigenous institutions which promote cultural sustainability. This paper examines perceptions of the role of waqf in Muslim society as evidenced in current online fatāwā and writings by Muslim scholars. These sources are drawn from English-medium, Muslim web organizations and sites which have particular appeal among Muslims living in the West. This literature propagates a historical narrative of waqf which highlights the institution's moral significance, civic identity, and economic efficiency, and plays down its pre-nineteenth-century links to state power and its potential inefficiency. According to modern day scholars, endowments, with the proper legal framework in place, can promote civil society and sustainability. In a bid to examine these issues, the paper analyzes how online sources address the historical development of waqf and legal mechanisms shaping the regulation of endowments. © 2014, © 2014 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to examine these relationships over the period from 2010 to 2018. Overall, the study found that the zakāt distribution contributes significantly to social welfare through education at a significance level of 5% and contributes inadequately through income level at 10% level of significance. This indicates that the current zakāt distribution system in Selangor provides only a marginal influence on increasing the income of the poor. Furthermore, the zakāt distribution was statistically insignificant to social welfare through healthcare. These findings suggest that the current distribution channels of health are insufficient to improve social welfare and should be improved by offering social health insurance policy for zakāt beneficiaries. This can be done via ratification insurance plan between zakāt agencies and insurance companies to cover the basic health needs for zakāt recipients. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of Zakat Institution is to ensure the poor and the needy receive assistance either in the form of financial or non-financial. This financial assistance can be in the form of monthly cash contribution for the purpose of personal consumption and business assistance. On the other hand non-financial assistance is in the form of sponsoring the needs of the zakat recipients such as food, medicine, education, business consultancy and training, and few others. The zakat institution has implemented various programs to assist the productive asnaf to start their own business. However, due to various responsibilities shouldered by Zakat Institution, the distribution has become less effective and yet to reach its full potential. Collaboration with other institution is expected to assist Zakat Institution in distributing the zakat fund to the rightful recipient in more efficient manner. Microfinance in zakat has caught the attention of the researchers lately due to the effectiveness of this program in assisting the poor to generate their own income. Nevertheless, the Zakat Institution's expertise is quite limited in executing such programs for the poor and the needy. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the conceptual approach in collaboration analysis for Zakat Institution and Microfinance Institution. Second, this paper tends to propose the collaboration model to be implemented by both institutions. Finally, this paper will also provide recommendations on proper instruments for Islamic microfinance as part of the Zakat Institution program.},

Waqf is generally regarded to be one of the most effective ways of expressing philanthropy for sustaining the welfare of the needy, the poor, the family, and the society. Through this philanthropic institution, wealth is transferred from private ownership to public utility. Personal assets of useful value can be endowed in waqf for the all-round services of the society; religious, social, economic, and educational sectors, under certain conditions and regultaions laid down by the Sharī'ah. Right from the time of the Holy Prophet, waqf has been benefitting people and defraying public expenses as it served as an effective means of funding mosques, graveyards, orphanages, schools, hospitals, bakeries, warehouses, mills, and numerous humanitarian or religious foundations. Similarly, this institution was successfully financing agriculture, horticulture and water resources during the previous centuries, as it was used to cater for the aged, infirm, destitute, and even animals. However, with the advent of colonialism in the Islamic world and subsequent negative transformation of Islamic culture and tradition, this strategic financial institution eventually started to turn into a shadow of its former glorious status. By adopting the narrative approach of qualitative research method, this study analyses the current administrative problems facing waqf institution in a bid to finding their lasting solutions and resuscitating its humanitarian functions. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.},

On the other hand Muslim countries across Asia and Africa are known or depicted as less developed and plagued by poverty. Several Malay Kingdoms throughout the Golden Chersonese together with Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo formed a new country known as Malaysia inherited some welfare policies from its former British rule. This paper intends to investigate and highlight the dimension of social welfare and social protection policy in Malaysia besides the establishment of Welfare Department during the British colonial times. It was found that the welfare concept has been part and parcel of the life of Malay people since their conversion to Islam long before the arrival of the European invaders. The welfare concept is derived from the Quran. Besides revealing the matters of faiths, the Quran also contains principles concerning relationship among human beings. Every member of society are taught and encouraged to take care the welfare of others. The act of charity towards the poor and needy has been mentioned by Allah in the Quran. This paper concluded that Malaysia as a predominantly Muslim country embraces the callings of welfare as stated in the Quran through wealth redistribution. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors have raised and tested a set of questions concerning the essence of the Islamic taxation model in relation to taxpayers' financial ethics. The main question of the research addresses key factors, which determine the advisability of introducing a special socially oriented tax with signs of zakat in the opinion of persons with low-level awareness of the Islamic tax system (the case of Russia). To challenge this question, it was considered appropriate to conduct a survey. Relevant factors were revealed by means of ordinal logit modeling. It was proved that the corresponding loyalty positively relates to the following statements: a) an individual should regularly donate a part of his income to support the socially vulnerable categories of the population; b) administrating socially oriented taxes should be the responsibility of special non-governmental organizations with publicly available and transparent reporting; c) any socially oriented expenditures should be taken into account in the personal income tax. The chances to support the abovementioned special tax are significantly higher for younger students. In summary, there is a clear interconnection between financial ethics and opportunities to implement the Islamic tax model. It should be noted that Islamic taxation, focused on personal and social responsibility of taxpayers, creates for them maximum convenience and ensures their involvement and commitment. In our opinion, these aspects need to be taken into account in the traditional tax administration. Therefore, we believe that in the question of an effective taxation, financial ethics really matters. Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management Association},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to report that the social business model has emerged to mitigate the failure of free-market capitalism driven by self-interest in creating social value. It shows how social business contradicts with free-market capitalism while being compatible with Islamic moral economy due to the axiomatic differences between the two economic systems. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows conceptual, axiomatic and theoretical approach to show how the social business model contradicts with free-market capitalism, but is compatible with Islamic moral economy. The paper provides a theoretical framework for Islamic social business based on an Islamic human and social development perspective. The paper first discusses the failure of free-market capitalism and the emergence of social business in the capitalist system. It then defines Islamic social business and lays out its axiomatic foundation based on the Islamic worldview. It also presents Islamic financial instruments and funds for social business. Finally, it makes a case for sustainable socioeconomic development and subjective well-being within the Islamic development paradigm. Findings – The paper shows that a cosmetic change to capitalism is not sufficient for enabling the social business model to take the main stage in the free-market system. There is a need for a new paradigm of reality, truth, telos and human nature to support social business. Tawhidi paradigm can be such alternative. The paper makes a strong case for social business from an Islamic worldview. Particularly, certain economic axioms within the Tawhidi anthropology, teleology and axiology provide intrinsic causes for pursuing such business model. The multi-dimensional nature of humans from the Tawhidi anthropology sets the intrinsic foundation for social business. Indeed, although the social business model is new to the West, it has been practiced in certain forms in the Muslim world throughout history. Zakat, sadaqah, and qard hasan can be used to support social business in addition to some Islamic banking instruments. The paper suggests that Muslim countries should embrace the social business model for sustainable development and greater subjective well-being. Research limitations/implications – The paper is purely theoretical. Future studies might shed light on the issue through empirical evidence. Practical implications – The paper is likely to enhance the interest in social business in the Muslim world. Social implications – The paper has potential to lead the creation of social value through dissemination of the social business model. Originality/value – The paper contributes the Islamic moral economy doctrine by making a strong case for Islamic social business. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

These microcredit institutions include both banking and non-banking institutions. But, in Pakistan where the majority of the population adheres to Islam as their code of life, many people are reluctant to impart the conventional micro financial institution on the religious grounds; Islam prohibits Riba in absolute terms. Present paper suggests a transforming change in the present methodologies of financing from conventional to Islamic one. The paper highlights the significance and comparative advantages of Islamic microfinance over conventional finance. Furthermore it claims that Islamic finance is a holistic, viable as well as a dynamic approach towards achieving the greater goals of development through expanding the financial inclusion of greater population. In additions, the paper makes an empirical examination the operations of an Islamic Mcrofinance NGO (GEAR) and concludes that Islamic Micro financing Institutions are doing significant contribution in capacity building of the financially excluded and marginalized segment of the society and these institutions are candles of hope and center of catharsis for these people. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

The comparative findings show mixed output between AIM and RDS performances. The AIM performance was quite remarkable in terms of operational self-sufficiency, earning revenue's and financial expenses but very low performance was recorded as well as institutional characteristics outreached to the poor and Efficiency especially on operating expenses in compare with RDS. Overall, the study recommended that AIM may adopt Islamic mode of microfinance as like as RDS, because of Islamic Microfinance is more about dealing with poor people more closely mitigating their socio-economic needs in a spiritual way.},

In observing the sustainability of BMT, there has been relatively little research involving aspects of the quality of the human resources that carry out internal activities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to create a model that is useful for predicting the sustainability of IMFIs, especially BMT, based on variables that are considered important, namely financing growth, Islamic human capital, fraud and Islamic leadership. The model was analysed using multiple regression analysis based on the stepwise method. The primary data (cross-sectional) were obtained in 2019 using questionnaires completed by 105 respondents comprising the administrators and managers of BMTs in Semarang and Pekalongan, Central Java, Indonesia. We found that only two variables have a significant influence on the sustainability of IMFIs: financing growth and Islamic human capital. Practitioners can apply the results of the study to improve the performance of Islamic microfinance, especially BMT, through the distribution of funding in the context of economic improvement (especially micro-enterprise), spiritual strengthening for human resources, risk prevention and appropriate leadership criteria. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {By exploring Islamic charitable clinics in Indonesia, this paper shows how community-based initiatives and zakat [Islamic charitable obligation] agencies have provided wider access to viable health services for destitute families in poor urban and rural areas. Zakat agencies, with their charitable clinics, have recently gained strong support from both society and the government. They have, for example, tried to bring a community response to the current social economic challenges through the revitalization of the zakat and Islamic charity practice. Low-priced, accessible and free medical assistance for poorer families and small economic enterprises provided by the zakat agencies reflect the endeavours of middle class Indonesian Muslims to translate Islamic discourse on social welfare in a more concrete way. The rise of Islamic charitable clinics, whose origins and motives can partly be linked to the Islamic discourse of the welfare of the ummah [the Islamic community], is without doubt a consequence of emerging interpretations of the meaning and function of Islamic aid in contemporary Indonesian Islam.},

It is, hence, timely that mutawalli's accountability from the acute dimensions of accounting and reporting are explored and examined. This effectively provides a basis for a reality check regarding the necessary improvements. Consistent with the above premise, this study explores the current accounting and reporting practices of two distinct mutawallis, operating on different operational platforms. Utilizing multiple research techniques comprising both interviews and record reviews, the preliminary empirical results are arguably informative and revealing, systematically providing an appropriate basis for a reality check on mutawalli's accountability.

Fueled by paternalistic state welfare policies and funded by the 1970s oil boom, most countries drastically expanded access to publicly provided social services and developed extensive health, education, and social protection systems. Islamic traditions of charity (for example, Zakat) and family support networks also helped countries manage social and economic risks. As a result, social infrastructures expanded rapidly, and key social indicators-such as child mortality rates, life expectancy, and literacy-show dramatic improvements in most countries. Nevertheless, major challenges remain. Poverty is a problem, with 30 percent of the region's population living on less than $2 a day. The low-income countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) have alarming levels of infant and maternal mortality and illiteracy, with limited resources to tackle these problems. In the middle- and high-income countries, health, education, and social protection systems must concentrate on targeting vulnerable populations and ensuring equity, quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability in the provision of services. What can be done to address the problems in the health, education, and social protection systems in the region? While the menu of policies is generic, each country's circumstances will dictate its priorities.},

	abstract = {Islamic philanthropy has a significant role in the spread of Islam and knowledge as well as in the establishment of institutions that suppot this religion and its activities. One type of Islamic philanthropy is waqf which is simply recommended but has played a role not less important than zakat which is obligatory. Waqf in Indonesia is a case in point. However, this type of philanthropy does not obtain a serious attention from the state. It is in what is known as refom era (era reformasi) that waqf is given an important attention through the issuance of Waqf Act in 2004 by the state. This paper analyzes the background of legislation of waqf in terms of economics, regulations and politics. To analyze the issues, this paper utilizes content analysis as its method accompanied by political, historical and theological approaches. Meanwhile, the materials used in this paper are documents related to the issues under discussion such as the Bill of Waqf Act, process of legislation of waqf and the 2004 Waqf Act, supported by other materials relevant to the issues. This paper argues that although waqf is religious matter, it cannot be separated from state affairs because it helpful to increase social welfare for which the state is responsible, and at the same time the legislation of waqf has accommodated Muslim interest.},

	abstract = {Being dependent on the public for funding, a transparent charity organization will more likely to gain confidence from potential donors. This paper focuses on waqf institution, a religious-based of charity organization. Waqf is an Islamic endowment. Waqf can be in the form of cash, property or assets that one donates for the social benefit of the society. Diverse examples of waqf asset include religious buildings, schools, cemeteries, orphanage, commercial and residential buildings and also fund for maintenance. The provision of waqf provides the giver with eternal reward as long as the waqf continues to benefit others either directly or indirectly. The perpetual nature of waqf makes it a highly effective platform for sustainable economic growth. Though many waqf organizations are private in nature, this paper examines transparency in state-owned waqf organizations in Malaysia. Waqf organizations in Malaysia are under the purview of state authorities. Each states set up its own authority to manage waqf. The trustee of waqf in Malaysia are managed by State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs). There are fourteen SIRCs each managing their own waqf organizations. This paper examines the information available on the websites of 14 state waqf organizations in Malaysia using content analysis approach. This study examines information on financial, management and media available in the organizations websites. As for the findings, most websites only provide basic organizational information, while financial matters such as collection and usage of fund were quite limited access. Information availability varies significantly among waqf institutions. Copyright © 2016 International Business Information Management Association},

	abstract = {Waqfs provided socio-economic security for the progeny of endowers and for other social welfare causes. Being thus guaranteed socio-economic well-being, these beneficiaries were antithetical to ruling elites in Muslim dynasties and Christian colonial powers, which led to the establishment of policies and institutions to control waqfs and check their growing influence. This development was not only counter to normative precepts but also set minority Muslims in predominantly Christian societies at odds with non-Muslim states. To what extent did civil policies and judgements influence waqfs? How did Muslims negotiate the secular state constructs vis-à-vis waqf practices? How did secular state control of waqfs influence the dynamics of Christian–Muslim relations? This discussion, based on ethnographic research in Kenyan coastal areas, employs two theoretical frameworks–Asad's ‘Islam as a discursive tradition’ and Scott’s concept of ‘symbolic (ideological) resistance’. The article draws mainly on the perspective of the Muslim minority in Kenya and argues that state control of waqfs in Kenya did not only interfere with normative practices but also partly laid the ground for the present-day economic and political marginalization and exclusion of Muslims, leading to suspicion and ambiguous relations with their Christian compatriots. © 2017 University of Birmingham.},

This article describes the solution to economic problems by applying the Islamic economic system correctly, through the distribution of more productive waqf and zakat aimed at the welfare of the people.

Consequently, this study hopes to contribute to the development of waqf institutions in terms of human capital proficiency, the efficiency of operations and the effectiveness and sustainability of performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reviewed a significant body of relevant studies written on various aspects of IC, to highlight the significance of considering IC in the operation of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and waqf institutions. Findings: This study highlights the importance of IC in the operation of waqf institutions. It provides a platform that facilitates understanding of the existing obstacles and challenges in waqf institutions (such as lack of accountability, lack of funding, mismanagement and lack of trained labour, among others) and offers potential solutions through the consideration of knowledge and IC. Research limitations/implications: This study is a conceptual analysis of IC in the context of NPOs. Future studies should conduct empirical testing, which will provide more detailed discussion and enriching insights into the issue of IC and the performance of NPOs, particularly in the case of waqf institutions. Practical implications: This study provides several important implications for waqf institutions and other NPOs, as it sheds light on the consideration of knowledge and IC in their operations. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to discuss the issues of waqf in the light of IC and provide an integrated framework for the operation of waqf institutions. © 2020, Abdelkader Laallam, Salina Kassim, Engku Rabiah Adawiah Engku Ali and Buerhan Saiti.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development of waqf (Endowment) property is the mutawalli's responsibility to make the waqf property productive and can produce benefits that can enhance or increase the value of the waqf properties. The development that not only contributes to welfare but also to finance or income is considered as one of the forms of sustainable development. This proves that sustainable development of waqf property can contribute to the socio-economic development of Muslims. However, how far is the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf can be comprehended appropriately? What are the characteristics of sustainable waqf property development? How can the concept of sustainability of waqf property development be implemented? These questions led to this study to identify the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf property. This study utilised the exploratory research design. Sources are gained from primary and secondary data. The primary data are obtained through in-depth interviews of six waqf practitioners comprising the officials at the State Islamic Religious Council (MAIN), who has been involved in managing waqf properties for more than five years. Secondary data is obtained from previous studies, such as thesis, books, articles, journals, magazines, and other publications. These data are then analysed by using qualitative content analysis using ATLAS. ti Version 8.0 (AV8) software. The results of this study found three elements in the concept of sustainable development of waqf property. The analysis found that there are forms of sustainable development on waqf land that especially involves socio-economic development as it can generate funds and increase the value of waqf property. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

We argue that the existing credit guarantee scheme (CGS) relies on government funding, but that in the current Covid-19 pandemic it is experiencing unstable financial capability. Hence, the sustainability of the CGS program is questionable. We employ the input-output (I-O) approach to identify the expected impact if the proposed FGS is applied. We further substantiate the proposal with seven Indonesian Syariah experts’ opinions, of whom five suggest that the alternative scheme is acceptable. The simulation using I-O shows that if IDR1 trillion (out of IDR10 trillion from ZIS funds in 2019) is disbursed through the scheme, this will increase economic growth by 0.0117%, representing economic activities worth IDR1.235 trillion, and creating 2,151 new jobs. We further discuss the implications of the findings for the Islamic banking industry in the future and for regulators. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite the fact that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in strengthening the financial sector within developing and emerging economies through providing employment opportunities to the rural and urban population, capacity building in the form of skills training and economic empowerment, they still face a plethora of challenges that continue to threaten their existence, performance and growth. Access to operational and administrative funds needed to execute their activities effectively is a significant challenge and detrimental to the growth of SMEs in Uganda. Conversely, Islamic microfinance has been noted as a panacea to the challenges of financial inaccessibility among SMEs, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate how the adoption of Islamic microfinance can play a fundamental role in enhancing the sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) while meeting the financing challenges of SMEs in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a review of existing literature was carried out to critically examine relevant information (literature sources) and empirical studies on SMEs, their performance and challenges. The study being conceptual tries to understand how Islamic microfinance could be adopted as an alternative scheme of financing to bridge the gap and mitigate the financial challenges facing SMEs. Findings: The study finds that the existing MFIs have failed to achieve their objectives of providing financial services to the poor and SMEs while remaining sustainable. This has left the majority of SMEs within Uganda's informal sector financially handicapped, thus leading to their failure in meeting their expectations and eventually collapsing even before celebrating their third or fourth birthdays. However, the enactment into law of the Financial Institutions Amendment Act 2016 that paved the way for the introduction of Islamic finance in Uganda, and the Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions and Money Lenders' Act, 2016 that incorporated the aspects of Islamic microfinance within the existing microfinance framework as seen and is perceived as a key factor in addressing the financial challenges faced by MFIs and the SMEs if fully adopted. Research limitations/implications: This study is conceptual with no empirical investigation and discussion of key theories. On the contrary, it will be imperative and useful when carrying out more extensive hypothetical studies by future researchers, specifically in the area of Islamic microfinance that is relatively new in Uganda. Practical implications: Practically, this paper will serve as a guide to policymakers and practitioners in the field of microfinance by adding a flair that could enable in bridging the challenges associated with inadequate financing of SMEs in Uganda. Social implications: Socially, the social aspects of charity (Zakah and Sadaqah) will help to improve the livelihood of the poorest of the poor who cannot engage in active business through meeting their basic needs of life without begging thereby preventing them from being social outcasts. Originality/value: The study establishes Islamic microfinance (IMF) as a promising and unexplored viable option potentially needed in intensifying the financing needs of SMEs in Uganda. The paper provides an entirely new dimension in nature and way microfinance products should be structured with a view of ensuring that there is sustainable provision of financial services to SMEs. The paper adds real value to the existing conventional microfinance products and services in Uganda, given the ethical and moral attributes of Islamic microfinancing practices that are assumed to efficiently and effectively motivate SME owners and other small entrepreneurs to thrive. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Efforts by global society to improve financial inclusion amongst the underprivileged have gained traction, but challenges abound to prevent a comprehensive success. Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging fintech industry brings about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees. Despite the introduction of disruptive fintech services, the needs generated by unimproved conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic fintech has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary (waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how fintech start-ups in Finland and Malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major fintech sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (P2P) financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances fintech services to elevate social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding, changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest that Islamic fintech offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance decisions. © 2020 SERSC.},

The findings explain the perspectives of local community after receiving the assistance, including the identification of reduction in numbers of local people affected by diarrhoea. This information may validate the relationships between health, water and sanitation. Furthermore, the findings capture the involvement of local government in the project execution.

	abstract = {The research objectives are to study the implementation of Islamic Corporate Social Responsibility (i-CSR) values in BMT UGT Sidogiri, an Islamic microfinance institution in Indonesia based on Islamic boarding school or pesantren. This research employed a post-positivist paradigm. Data observation was performed by conducting an in-depth interview with several informants. The data analysis utilized an interactive model technique. The research results showed that i-CSR was successfully implemented in the Islamic microfinance institution based on Islamic boarding school due to the mutual passion (convergence) with conventional CSR typologies. The convergence is in two ways, firstly managerial behavior that focuses on protecting company stakeholders, second, creating sustainable corporate values through effective and efficient business activities. The orientation is the creation of a social role based on justice and sustainable development. The convergence is mainly in the dimensions of economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic responsibilities. The Islamic values have enriched the implementation of i-CSR as the form of practicing the teachings of Islam and evidence of human servitude to God so that the behaviors become worthy of worship. The implementation of i-CSR focused on the Islamic teachings. Compliance to Islamic jurisprudence and apply it in business activities became a divergent element of conventional CSR concept. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. },

	abstract = {Transportation infrastructure is a pillar of economic development as well as a main contributor to climate change. Therefore, it is necessary to transform the transport sector investment into climate-resilient, low-carbon transportation choices in order to achieve sustainable transportation infrastructure. In case of China, this transformation might be necessary from the perspective of the “New-style Urbanization” strategy, and for fulfilling this strategy, policy realignment is required. To address this policy-level void in the literature, we explore the influence of public private partnerships investment in transport sector, renewable energy consumption, urbanization on transport-induced carbon emissions in China. For this purpose, we apply Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (QARDL) method during 1990Q1-2018Q4. Based on the results of the study, a multipronged sustainable development goal (SDG) framework has been suggested, under which SDG 11, SDG 13, and SDG 8 are addressed, while using SDG 17 as a vehicle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In developed and developing nations including Malaysia, the governments provide financial assistance such as subsidies, tax deductions and financial assistance to help the households with children. However, limited government resources as well as focusing too much on economic growth in the region have restricted the assistance it can provide to the households. Thus, there are many private and charitable sources of funding that exist especially for those in need. For Muslims, there are numerous philanthropic organizations that regularly collect various charitable funds in differ ent forms, such as Zakat, Waqf, Sadaqah, and Hibah. Waqf instrument plays an important role in Muslim societies as its support the aged, the poor, the orphans through provision of education, training and business activities. Waqf institutions have managed to provide social welfare services that many current states struggle to offer. The establishment of Waqf institutions all over the Muslim world was indeed the result of worship towards Allah. This study aims to find out the permissibility of using the Waqf fund for developing of childcare facilities and the best way of its implementation. This study employs a qualitative research methodology based on deductive method of analysis of jurisprudential and literature based-evidences. The conclusion that can be drawn from this research is; Waqf for child care is permissible and can be accomplished through Waqf’s asset integration. This study also proposes the strategies of creation Waqf for childcare facilities through the modification of Waqf fund in few ways. © 2021, CA and C Press AB. All rights reserved.},

We do so by developing the agent-based model and scenario-based computer simulations for financing solar powerplants. For this purpose, we redesign a waqf-based financing system and analyze the changes in wealth inequality, capital pooling, and social prosperity for a future time frame. As a proof-of-concept, the simulation results show that for the given case study, the proposed WOFI reduces wealth inequality dramatically, whereas conventional debt-based financing models raise inequality. Besides, restructuring the waqf-based financial intermediaries also enables the capital pooling essential for large projects and absent in the conventional waqf system. In short, this study proves that waqf-based institutions have a remarkable potential to contribute towards sustainable development goals by taking account of long-run social implications, economic growth, and environment-friendly projects. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Poverty is a crucial and worldwide phenomenon. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship exists between socio-economic factors, social factors, and poverty, the relative influence of economic and social factors on poverty and to describe causality between time series in the VAR system. This study utilized the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) by using quarterly time-series data, 1994Q1 to 2018Q4, that have been collected from the world development indicators (WDI) and Economic Survey of Pakistan. The study identified education, unemployment, inflation as economic factors while zakat and rainfall as social factors that can reduce poverty. The findings of this study indicate that inflation and unemployment have a positive and significant relationship with poverty in the long run in Pakistan while education, rainfall, social welfare programs, and zakat has a negative relationship in the long run with poverty. Besides, the study also found that in the short run, there is no relationship between economic and social factors with poverty. Moreover, the study found that in the long run that the relative contribution of education and rain increases, 28% and 20%, is greater than the contribution of inflation, social welfare programs, unemployment and zakat, 3.8%, 0.5%, 2.5%, and 0.08%. Similarly, its contribution to poverty reduces up to 44% in the long run. This study helps policymakers to take important decisions about economic and social factors while designing policies to reduce poverty. The results suggest that the state bank of Pakistan should adopt a contractionary monetary policy to control inflation and policymakers can develop policies like education for all. The government should develop a business environment to create more employment opportunities. © 2021 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

The paper investigates whether the extensive use of banking logic changes IMFs, from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts mixed methods by analyzing 7,200 microfinance data from Microfinance Exchange Market and reviewing annual reports and websites of 25 IMFs to examine their vision and mission statements and other related information. Findings: The finding shows Islamic microfinance has not changed, despite increasing adoption of financial or banking performance measures. However, size and age of the institutions may affect the outcome in the future. The authors find that smaller microfinance institutions maintain genuine objective to serve the poor, as the grow larger they would be more inclined toward sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited on the sample size as data on Islamic microfinance globally is limited. However, the paper looked at the global data rather than local data to compensate for this limitation. Future study would be further taking the study through qualitative methods to support the study. Originality/value: This paper aims to shed some lights on the process of mission drifting or abandoning poverty objective by IMFIs. The paper investigates how has the extensive use of financing logic has changed IMFIs from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Arun and Hulme (2009) argued that the interaction of multiple logic within microfinance institutions, i.e. financial vs social, could pose some serious management dilemmas within microfinance institutions. Further, commercialization puts pressure on the field staffs to achieve financial targets and often neglect their poverty outreach mission to the poor. The well-known crisis in Andhra Pradesh, India where clients of microfinance institutions committed suicide after being shamed by field officers who tried to collect payments of loans (Mader, 2013; Taylor, 2011), provides a powerful case of the impact of financialization to microfinance clients. © 2019, Luqyan Tamanni and Mohd Hairul Azrin Haji Besar.},

Both renewable energy consumption and innovation show a negative impact on emissions of CO2 related to transport. It depicts that due to the increase in renewable energy and innovation, the CO2 emission in the transport sector is likely to decrease; however, an increase in the GDP of a country will upsurge the emission of CO2 in the transportation sector. However, China should make new policies to introduce innovation in the transportation sector to minimize the emission of CO2. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOS’s management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOS’s financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOS’s not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010.

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to identify the effects of ethical values reflected on zakat and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on the financial performance of sharia banking in Indonesia. This study contributes to the Indonesia Financial Service Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) policies concerning the need for implementing ethical values in sharia banking and other sharia financial entities based on the philanthropic model, this study posits that firms undertaking zakat and charity are ethical firms. The population of this study is 8 sharia banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2014-2018. The result of the study showed that zakat disclosure significantly affected financial performance. Moreover, ethical values that were proxied by CSR disclosure did not significantly affect financial performance. The limitation of the study is the limited number of the sample; therefore, it is expected that the future research adds other sharia financial entities and adds the dimension of management, sustainability, product, and the environment as benchmarks of ethical values. The originality of this study offers an additional explanation of the relationship between ethical values and performance by investigating zakat and CSR disclosure which is a unique factor in Indonesia. © 2021.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose a hybrid microfinance model that integrates various Islamic commercial and social finance institutions through Fintech for efficient and impactful results. The microfinance model caters to the financial and social intermediation needs through a set of financial services and non-financial support. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses both a mathematical model and an empirical estimation using micro panel data to establish the core problem in microfinance operations. Conclusions from the mathematical model and estimated results in the empirical analysis are used to suggest an institutional design which embeds technology in the delivery of Islamic microfinance in an integrated structure. For screening and incentive conditions, the study gives illustration through numerical examples. Findings: The mathematical model highlights the need for financial sustainability, outreach, scale and complementariness of non-financial factors such as commitment, repayment incentives and skills enhancement multiplier. In light of this, the proposed Islamic microfinance model is outlined to create synergies by integrating a diversity of funding sources through social savings and impact investments. The programme also blends financial services with non-financial support to ensure engagement and commitment on a long-term basis. It uses Fintech in various demand and supply-side operations to show how technology embeddedness can help in achieving cost efficiencies and extend outreach. Originality/value: It is the first study in integrated institutional design in Islamic microfinance literature that embeds Fintech in both demand side and supply side operations comprehensively. The proposed model is conducive for enhancing outreach, scale and impact in the Islamic microfinancial services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a sustainable Islamic microfinance design using an appreciative intelligence approach to enhance the poor borrowers' accessibility to micro financing in Indonesia. This study aims to identify problems faced by BMT in Indonesia and find the solution to implement sustainable Islamic microfinance. It uses a qualitative analysis by adopting an appreciative intelligence approach. Data was collected by interviewing the Chairman and officer of Central BMT (Induk Koperasi Syariah), Jakarta in 382 BMT's throughout Indonesia. The steps: (i) reframing problems into possibilities, (ii) appreciating the positive meaning and promise of every being, experience, situation, and (iii) linking the generative strength of the present with the preferred vision. The results show that BMT faced four problems in implementing sustainable Islamic microfinance, namely lending limit regulation, high funding pricing to the borrowers, APEX BMT realization, and productive use funding. Several solutions have been suggested by using the appreciative intelligence approach. This paper adds to the literature on Islamic microfinance by enabling researchers and practitioners to apply the appreciative intelligence model of sustainable Islamic microfinance. It also contributes towards enriching the knowledge in the Islamic microfinance and sustainable Islamic microfinance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The population of this research are 573 beneficiaries of zakat and 236 samples (Slovin formula). Respondents are members of the BAZNAS (Badan Amil Zakat Nasional) business group in West Java Province. The results show that all Zakat Community Development’s (ZCD) have sufficient sustainability values from an economic perspective. The Squared Correlation (RSQ) value is 91.85 percent, and therefore, it suggests that the results of the Multidimensional Scaling analysis on the Zakat Community Development from an economic perspective can be explained as very good.

This paper identifies that the educational thought and experiences of Imam Zarkasyi as well as his religious inclination played an important role in his modernization of pesantren. The research also found that Imam Zarkasyi's thought and practices in modernizing Pesantren system started from his serious observation and evaluation as well as his appreciation of traditional pesantren and madrasah system of education. The step taken by Imam Zarkasyi to modernize the education system was by integrating pesantren and madrasah system. In modernizing curriculum Imam Zarkasyi integrated the formal, non-formal and informal education utilizing pesantren environment. Students are taught not only subjects on religion and general sciences in the classroom, but also obtaining morality, mental and job skill education and other values in pesantren tradition within a well-designed informal and non-formal education. Finally, to ensure the sustainability of pesantren Imam Zarkasyi changed the status of Pesantren institution from personal ownership into public property by way Waqf. The thought had been practically implemented successfully in secondary level and now the Waqf Board started to implement the practice at university level. © 2020 STAIN Kudus. All rights reserved.},

The results support that the institutional contributory performance (ICP) having a positive effect, and the level of sustainable development of zakat recipients (SDZR) do increase after receiving zakat, but there are issues that need careful addressing. The study further examined the moderating role of demographic factors, such as earnings, age, marital status and gender, and witnessed that after zakat, all parameters improved, though individual moderating variables yet to show any significance.

Data are taken from national-level survey Household Integrated Income and Consumption Survey 2015–2016. Inclusion of gender dimensions of some important factors and estimation of varying estimates at four severity levels of households’ food insecurity status using partial proportional odds model may be considered unique features of the study. It is concluded that household's income, employment, agricultural income, donations, parental education level and some households’ characteristics are important factors for improving food security in Pakistan. Maternal education, and maternal paid employment compared to paternal education, and paternal paid employment show strong positive effects to improve severe food insecurity. Couple paid employment, livestock ownership and operating agricultural land seem to have the most effective role for improving food security. Social welfare programmes and religious institution of Zakat are helpful to cope with severe food insecurity in Pakistan. Some special efforts or development strategies are recommended to improve food insecurity of rural households and Baluchistan province. Moreover, the observed U-type quadratic impact of household size and the adverse impact of dependency ratio induce effective policies to control high birth rate in Pakistan. Hence, creation of employment opportunities especially for women, appreciation of couple paid employment, easy access to education for women, steps to raise level of education, growth of agricultural sector, rural development, social welfare and development schemes for Baluchistan, and continuation of Benazir Income Support Program are recommended to overcome severe and moderate level food insecurity in Pakistan. Since socioeconomic conditions and food insecurity issues of developing countries and especially in South Asian countries are homogeneous and therefore, the analysis in this study might be relevant to South Asian region. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The study is based on both primary and secondary data. The primary data are collected through questionnaires and secondary data from various sources. Performance of the institution is assessed in terms of growth and sustainability indicators. Findings: It is found that BuN has been successful in providing interest-free microfinance services in India. A few operational issues have been highlighted and possible solutions are recommended. Moreover, it is found that in comparison to the microfinance industry standards, the performance of BuN has been lower. Research limitations/implications: BuN is evaluated from only growth and sustainability aspects and not from the aspect of the socio-economic impacts of its services on the lives of customers. Practical implications: This study would become a documented source of interest-free microfinance practices in India. Moreover, the recommendations provided, if implemented, would help BuN in further growth and development. Social implications: This study would help create awareness in the society about the practices of interest-free microfinance.

	abstract = {Despite the importance of microfinancing as a tool for alleviating poverty, formal financial institutions, such as banks, are reluctant to provide this type of financing. There is, therefore, a need to provide financing indirectly through linkage programs. Launched by Bank Indonesia on January 9, 2004, the linkage program is the first pillar of the Indonesian Banking Architecture, and serves as a comprehensive framework for the development of the Indonesian banking industry. The program provides financing through cooperatives to their members operating microbusinesses. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of linkage pro-grams provided by Islamic banks for microfinancing through Islamic cooperatives known as houses of charity (baitul maal wa tamwil, BMT). This research was conducted by using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative information was collected using in-depth interviews with the management and author-ized officers from five BMTs that are knowledgeable about such cooperatives. The quantitative research was conducted by analyzing the cooperatives’ financial statements and conducting a direct survey of the recipients of financing. The effectiveness of a microfinancing program is commonly measured by three aspects, known as the “the triangle of microfinance.” These aspects are the extent to which the financing provides for the poor (outreach), whether it increases the income or assets of the target population (impact), and the business sur-vival of institutions managing the financing (institution sustainability). We found that linkage programs had a positive impact, especially on improving the affordability of outreach in small and medium-sized but not in the large BMTs. We suggest that the Indonesian Bank or Indonesian Financial Service Authority should specifically encourage medium-sized cooperatives or BMTs to employ this program by providing more incentives for banks or reducing the barriers for BMTs to participate. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Purpose: Bringing more impact seems to be a real issue for social initiatives and organizations requiring the adoption of new approaches. The paper aims to define an integrated approach for building, maintaining and upgrading Islamic social finance and sustainable ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a conceptual framework based on case studies and literature review describing the methodology and the necessary steps to build sustainable ecosystems. Findings: The paper shows the impact of building social finance ecosystems on tackling social issues. It emphasizes the idea that solving social issues is everybody’s business – from governments to businesses – and that those initiatives require sufficient Sharīʿah-compliant funding to achieve sustainability goals. Research limitations/implications: The paper does not focus on the Islamic world experiences in building ecosystems serving social causes. Practical implications: The paper gives an overview on how collaboration between the different social oriented organisations can enhance the social impact of the different initiatives. The aim is to ensure adequate financing to all the ecosystem components during the whole lifecycle. Social implications: The suggested approach of building sustainable ecosystems can serve as a way to assess the existing social initiatives and practices to find relevant combinations targeting more impact. Originality/value: In the social sphere, the idea of building ecosystems has been explored in different ways but never in a way that gathers all the components including finance providers, coordinators and the different types of initiatives. The paper adapts the ecosystem concept to the Islamic finance specificities. © 2019, Ahmed Tahiri Jouti.},

	abstract = {Indonesia as a country with the largest Muslim population in the world has an Islamic microfinance concept that has a strategic role in carrying out the triple bottom line mission, namely economic development, community empowerment, and preaching (da'wah). In practice, Indonesia has a unique microfinance concept called Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil (BMT) which is an Islamic microfinance concept that carries out a commercial orientation through tamwil activities and social orientation through maal activities. The importance of the sustainability of BMT performance in Indonesia, this requires a model framework that is in accordance with the characteristics of the company to direct, manage, and assess the operations of the Accounting Information System (AIS) to achieve sustainability performance. Therefore, this study will explore the characteristics of the Accounting information system, task characteristics, and implementation of Maqashid Sharia on the suitability of the information technology provided (Task Technology Fit/TTF) and its impact on Perceived usefulness and sustainability performance of BMT.

The quality of the loan portfolio is very crucial as the loans are typically not backed by any physical collateral. Having dual roles of achieving social and financial objectives, lenders require the microfinance institutions to have long-Term financial sustainability. The study aims to gauge whether financial risks of Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions are pro-cyclical to economic conditions. The study utilises the dataset of 39 microfinance institutions for Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan from 2007 to 2013. Findings indicate that financial risks are pro-cyclical with economic conditions for both Islamic and conventional banking institutions. However, Islamic microfinance institutions are exposed to a higher financial risk during an economic downturn. This implies that Islamic microfinance institutions should improve the quality of their portfolio to preserve sustainability and resilience. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

It is interesting to study the implementation of economic justice through waqf and how its regulation in Indonesia. This article employed normative juridical method. Based on the Article 22 of the Law Number 41 of 2004 on Waqf, the purpose of waqf is not solely for the purpose of ritual. It can also be used to realize economic prosperity. Based on these provisions, waqf can be managed for the economic empowerment of the people. This is related to the efforts of the improvement of the economic welfare of the people, especially for the weak economic class. According to Islamic teachings, distributive justice is economic justice based on the Holy Quran, Chapter al-Hasyr (59): 7. Waqf has the potential to create the economic balance of society. Because the principle of ownership, according to Islam, regulates that individuals or certain community members are not the only party who control the management of assets. The weak economic class also have the right. It is to avoid economic inequality. Thus, waqf is a solution to actualize economic justice in order to realize public welfare, which is one of Indonesia’s national goals as stated in the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, Padjadjaran University.

The data waere collected through a questionnaire that was distributed to 600 respondents in six districts or cities in two provinces. Respondents were randomly selected at the village level. The results showed that social solidarity during Ramadan was high (3.32) with values of the spirit of togetherness (3.37), collective consciousness (3.32) and cooperation (3.28). In addition, philanthropy was included in a high category (3.27) with different values of alms (3.49), infaq (3.23) and waqf (3.10). Therefore, it can be concluded that Ramadan contributes positively to the social solidarity of Muslim communities in Indonesia. The result can be used to develop a model of social solidarity in overcoming the problem of disintegration. Furthermore, it improves Muslim philanthropy for social welfare and to overcome the problem of poverty.

In fact, Law No. 41 of 2004 concerning Waqf also regulates assets other than immovable property. One of these assets is Intellectual Property Rights. The economic potential of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) becomes an opportunity to realize prosperity for the community. This paper identifies IPR regimes that can be used as waqf and constraints in their implementation. The results show that the regulation of entire IPR Law allows the rights transfer through waqf with several adjustments, i.e., the term of the Copyright waqf must be adjusted to the period of copyright protection in Indonesia. In addition, the transfer of rights in the copyright waqf only covers Economic Rights. This means that Moral Rights are still attached to waqif. Constraints to the implementation of IPR waqf include the absence of legal rules at the technical level as a direction to waqif and Nazhir to carry out the transfer of rights. Another obstacle found was the absence of the role of Indonesian Waqf Board (BWI) in improving Nazhir's competence regarding Intellectual Property Rights. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the existing Islamic financial technology (fintech) lending in Indonesia. Doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: This study engages qualitative methods. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of Islamic fintech. Further, the existing literature of SDGs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in Indonesia. Following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of Islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition. The selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the SDGs. Finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of Indonesia in implementing SDGs. Findings: This work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute Islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community. In some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms’ effort in promoting SDG of ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and reducing the inequalities (SDG 10). Research limitations/implications: The discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used. Practical implications: The Indonesian Government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in SDG 15 (life on land). Social implications: This work elaborates in what way the Islamic fintech lending has been promoting the SDGs in Indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in Indonesia. Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of Islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of SDGs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the zakat management of zakat institutions. Zakat is an Islamic obligation to donate a portion of one’s wealth. This is because the income of the muzakki (the people who pay the zakat) decreased. The pandemic caused the decline of people’s income, thus increasing the number of mustahik (zakat recipients). This condition encourages the application of a zakat empowerment concept that aims to accelerate people’s economy. AIM: This paper aims analyze the zakat empowerment concept in the health and welfare aspects during the pandemic, to obtain legal protection based on the benefit (maslahah) and policy theories. METHODS: This qualitative research aims to focus on the zakat empowerment concept in the aspects of health and welfare during the pandemic. RESULTS: The zakat institutions may channel the zakat to the mustahik who are affected by the pandemic in the form of medicine, COVID-19 vaccines, and capitals to families whose breadwinners lost their jobs or died due to the pandemic. This qualitative research aims to analyze the zakat empowerment concept during the pandemic in the aspects of health and welfare and its legal protection based on benefit (maslahah) theory and the policy theory. According to the policy theory, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic is according to Law No. 23 of 2011 on Zakat Management. CONCLUSION: According to the maslahah theory, it is categorized as a maslahah hajiyah from the basis of maslahah al-mursalah. However, to give legal certainty and legal protection, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic should be validated in legal regulation. © 2021 Moch Chotib.},

Therefore, it plays a significant role as an Islamic social finance instrument that could finance specific programs to achieve social, political, and economic development among Muslim communities. This study aims to analyze the impact of zakat distribution in achieving sustainable development goals in the state of Kedah, given the constraint faced by the Kedah State Zakat Board. This study employs secondary data and documentation and uses descriptive analysis to analyze the data and answer the research objective to provide empirical evidence and justifications to the analysis. This study reveals that zakat distribution in Kedah, Malaysia was in line with sustainable development goals (SDGs). Thus, there is excellent potential to achieve the SDGs provided that zakat institutions make specific alignments and improvements to improve the effectiveness of zakat distribution to achieve the targeted SDGs. However, its success still depends upon the amount of zakat collection and better management. © Authors 2021},

The globalization-led economic growth achieved by the emerging economies might not be ecologically sustainable, as globalization might not have been utilized as a policy tool. Moreover, a sound policy calls for considering the entire data spectrum for the analysis, which is largely ignored in the literature. This research contributes to the literature by proffering a policy framework for the emerging economies by analyzing the impact of globalization and tourism on environmental degradation, by considering the Chinese context as a sample. Following the quantile autoregressive distributed lag model, the impact of economic growth, globalization, and tourism on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the ecological footprint in China over 1978Q1-2017Q4 are analyzed. The results demonstrate that economic growth stimulates environmental degradation, while the presence of Environmental Kuznets Curve is also validated. Moreover, tourism has been found to exert positive environmental externalities, while globalization exerts negative environmental externalities. Based on the outcomes of the research, a comprehensive policy framework has been suggested, following which the Chinese economy might be able to attain the objectives of Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, and 13. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The article describes the latest developments of Islamic charities and their role as major non-state actors in Indonesia's field of social welfare. It considers debates about the practices of Islamic charity in colonial and post-colonial times when zakat (obligatory almsgiving) was conceptualized as social welfare and as a tool for social justice or as an instrument to implement the post-colonial state's development goals. We examine the contemporary popularity of sedekah (voluntary almsgiving) among Indonesian middle-class Muslims and the rise of Islamic charities that specialize in sedekah programmes. These charities use social media to document their activities and to raise funds, and have changed the discourse of almsgiving. We argue that the temporal logic of acceleration increasingly informs the field of social welfare in Indonesia today. Islamic charities display their efficiency, transparency, and the material rewards that sedekah practices bring to donors. Today, Islamic charity is no longer primarily associated with social welfare and social justice but increasingly with economic gain. Accordingly, charities are concerned with accelerating their aid and its mediation, emphasizing immediacy in order to appeal to donors who demand a quick, unbureaucratic conversion of donations into concrete help, and an immediate material and spiritual return on their ‘investment’. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The findings reveal that zakat helps to improve the overall sustainable development status of its recipients, but the economic aspect improves more than the social and environmental aspects. Therefore, to ensure the success of zakat in line with the goals of achieving sustainable development for recipients as advocated by the United Nations, the policymakers and zakat administrators around the world and particularly in Malaysia need to focus on redesigning the zakat management program.

	abstract = {Recently, the importance of waqf (endowment) has emerged with increasing global interest in sustainable development. The revival of cash waqf as one of the most important types of waqf, as well as the advent of new uses, have resulted in the formation of new Fiqh (juristic) difficulties. This is due to the flexibility and efficiency of cash waqf in mobilizing financial resources for Islamic countries' economic and social development programs. This paper discusses the importance of the juristic issues arising from waqf sukuk (bonds). These issues are zakat, rahn (collateral), and the exchange of waqf sukuk. The paper concludes that zakat is not obligatory on permanent and temporary waqf sukuk, neither on the waqf founder (sukuk holder) nor on the beneficiaries. A distinction is made between debt and qard in regard to the obligation of zakat on the creditor in debt but not in qard. The exchange of sukuk sukuk is discussed in light of juristic disagreement in replacing the waqf asset, adopting permissibility within the Shariah guidelines and precautions. Finally, this paper adopts the impossibility of using waqf sukuk as collateral by the sukuk holder in order to safeguard the waqf asset. This study, on the other hand, waqf sukuk accepts the permissibility in analogy to the permissibility of mortgaging the debt for the benefit of a third party other than the debtor, by using the temporary waqf sukuk as collateral by the sukuk holder. © 2021 Darulfunun Ilahiyat.

This study provides a brief overview of recent Waqf research developments, hence paving the way for future research. The research employs a bibliometric approach to analysing and summarising the trends and status quo in Waqf growth. Only articles written in English extracted from both the Web of Science and Scopus databases were considered for the study. The paper is an attempt to establish a solid conceptual base and to suggest directions for future research. The research provides a clear picture of the growth of Waqf, and indicates research gaps by reaching comprehensive conclusions about what has been achieved in the field. It hence opens new doors for scholars to develop innovative Waqf models to bridge socioeconomic issues. Our findings show that Indonesian and Malaysian scholars and their educational institutions have had a robust research commitment to the theme of Waqf during the last forty years. However, there is a lack of research on the countries where Waqf was first practised. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This research paper aims to highlight the criteria of the administrative management of waqf-based hospitals during the Islamic Golden Era of 8t h-14t h CE from Islamic history and explore the criteria of the hospitals implemented during the aforesaid medieval period. These hospitals have managed to incorporate and integrate waqf with the public goods such as to provide good healthcare services to the Muslim Ummah in their era. This study however, have not found in-depth investigation of past waqf hospitals and documentations to show how their significance, standards and criteria which have managed to successfully evolve and integrate the Islamic culture with the changing of civilization through time. This study examines the macro-level theory pertaining to past waqf-based hospitals in the 8t h-14t h CE, and applies the grounded theory approach, analysis from the historical-comparative (H-C) and triangulation (Neuman 2014) from a qualitative perspective. In determining the themes and detecting important critical terms crucial for this study, open coding was performed on the data collected using the application NVivo 12. The general finding shows that the exclusive elements of the guiding principles of Nour, architectural and urbanism features, decentralization, al-Mizan, governance of the Mutawalli and the financial sustainability found, exist in tandem as fundamental elements for the criteria of past waqf-based hospitals whilst defining each other in their own representations. This study suggests that, the application of the medieval/classical epistemology should be a basis for a current and future developments especially in the application of waqf with a public service organization, healthcare services in particular. © 2020 Islamic Cultural Centre.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses Istisna’a as a tool of MP and examines its effects on key macroeconomic variables on purely theoretical ground. The effectiveness and the impact of Istisna’a-based MP is examined by using aggregate output and aggregate expenditure model, embedded with Islamic economic principles, including zakat function. Findings: Istisna’a-based MP immediately creates well paid jobs, positively contributes and expands the size of the manufacturing sector, increases capital per person employed, labor productivity and thus increases output, employment and promotes industrialization. Increase in the size of manufacturing sector will not only increase manufactured value-added exports but also cut high valued manufactured imports and thus increases positive trade balance and eventually reduces trade deficits. Increase in labor productivity will improve the standard of living, and eventually the economy will yield sustainable high growth rates, full employment and prosperity. Originality/value: This is probably one of the first attempt to systematically develop the Istisna’a-based MP with detailed MP transmission mechanism. This new contribution in the field of Islamic MP will unveil the horizon of sustainable economic growth, creation of well paid jobs, expansion of manufacturing sector, rapid industrialization and the increase in capital per person employed across the economy, and eventually Istisna’a-based MP will be one of the most effective tool of MP for transforming an economy into a relatively higher and sophisticated stages which will eventually promote sustainable development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aims to estimate the impact of wide-ranging parameters on environmental circumstances in South Asian countries. This analysis required two approaches: 1)quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) as an econometric model, and 2) data envelopment analysis (DEA) non-parametric comparable composite index to examine concurrently South Asian nations' data for the 2000–2018 period. The underscored category of the parameters were grouped into four key indices, namely financial, fiscal, human, and energy. The DEA's mathematical composite findings reveal varied circumstances regarding environmental self-maintenance in South Asian nations. India and Pakistan are doing quite well; Afghanistan is abysmal. In addition, the QARDL approach findings reveal that energy use and fiscal indicators abate pollution. Furthermore, the correlation between fiscal decentralization and ecological attributes is strengthened by the excellent level of institutions and human capital progress. There is a unidirectional impact emanating from fiscal devolution, gross domestic product, human capital, eco-innovation, and institutional excellence on carbon dioxide pollution, although different from the other correlations obtained. © 2021},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the roles of Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan within the context of the existing literature as major Islamic financial instruments for enhancing socio-economic justice amongst Muslims haves and have-nots as these enhance financial inclusion in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The discussion in this paper is based on secondary sources such as the divine knowledge contained in the Qur’an, Hadiths and the existing literature, such as previously conducted empirical studies and Islamic world view (Tawhidi epistemology). Findings: This paper implores Islamic societies to use Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan as instruments that encourages wealth redistribution that promotes efficient and effective wealth redistribution between haves and have-nots as part of the vicegerent (khaliphah) role between mortal being (human) and his immortal creator (Allah). This paper concludes by suggesting the use of these Islamic financial instruments as means to enhance socio-economic justice and financial inclusion in the Nigeria’s Muslims’ communities that are negatively affected by the high rate of financial exclusion and poverty as had been previously practiced in the Muslim world throughout the Islamic history. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides critical suggestions on the ways Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan will contribute significantly towards assisting Nigeria in achieving its vision of reducing the financial exclusion rate that is currently put at 41.6% to 20% by the year 2020 and may foster inclusive growth and sustainable development. However, the limitation is that it is a mare conceptual study, and the future researchers may subject it to the scientific test to offer empirical evidence regarding the roles of Zakat, Sadaqah and Qardhul Hassan towards closing the gap of financial exclusion in Nigeria. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the existing literature on the doctrine of the Islamic moral economy by recommending the adoption of Islamic financial instruments as tools for enhancing income redistribution and financial inclusion. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The microfinance industry has contributed significantly to sustainable socioeconomic growth. In spite of its remarkable significance, microfinance still faces some obstacles in the industry. A significant challenge is its poor performance in terms of business growth due to lack of integrative approaches and creative resources. In response to this issue, a collaboration between Waqf and Microfinance is proposed to develop socioeconomic growth for sustainability. However, the element of urgency as an intangible resource is needed to ensure the collaboration practice will perform well and significantly contribute towards sustainable socioeconomic growth. Thus, this study aims to examine the impact of urgency on the performance of Waqf-Microfinance project collaborations. To contextualize sustainability within the collaborative practice, this study has evaluated the mediating influence of sustainability in terms of the relationship between urgency and the performance of Waqf-Microfinance collaborative projects. Subsequently, the advance partial least square technique (PLS) was employed as the primary approach to assessing the research model of the study. A quantitative approach was employed in this study. Industry practitioners are encouraged to adopt this research framework in developing a model that can provides a comprehensive guideline on the importance of urgency to enhance the performance of waqf- microfinance collaboration. © Estudios de Economia Aplicada 2021.},

The purpose of this paper is to focus on Shariah-based microfinance products in the context of sustainable poverty alleviation approach and provide them financial benefits to enhance their livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach: Here, this qualitative study critically analyzes the basics of the sustainable Islamic microfinance to exterminate the level of poverty. Findings: Islamic microfinance is a more ethical practice than the traditional motives of profit maximization, and it encourages extending the time of repayment if the debtors are in hardship. In some case, it suggests to give charity if the creditor has capability. Research limitations/implications: Most importantly, research scholars and experts have already criticized the concept of conventional microfinance on the basis of various points, especially for its high rate of interest. Social implications: Islamic microfinance is provided with a view to fulfill two tools simultaneously, i.e., social and financial inclusion. In this case, credits and Zakah can be given to the extreme poor people for satisfying basic needs. In terms of social responsibility, Islam encourages the people to be soft in case of collecting the lending money. Originality/value: The study discoursed that sustainable Islamic Microfinance (IM) may be a promising future option to draw the attention of the religiously sensitive people toward the Shariah-based microfinance which can, in turn, mitigate the poverty level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Waqf (Islamic endowment) is considered one of the alternative solutions to environmental problems in Indonesia. One of the examples is through the establishment of a waqf forest, a conservation initiative in the form of developing forests on waqf land. The development of waqf forests needs to pay attention to the legal side in accordance with the laws and regulations of Indonesia. Previous studies discussed the process of legalizing waqf land in Indonesia, but research about the legalization of waqf forest land is still scarce. This study aims to determine the process of legalizing waqf forests on the basis of Indonesian laws and regulations. On the basis of the results of literature studies and expert interviews that were analyzed descriptively, the process of legalizing waqf forest is one of the main tasks of a nazir (waqf manager). The process involves at least three government agencies: the Ministry of Religion, the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning (National Land Agency), and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The waqf forest legalization process begins with making a waqf pledge deed at the local Office of Religious Affairs, followed by creating a waqf land certificate at the local Land Offices. A crucial step is to clarify that the represented land must be located outside the forest area through a statement from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The legalization of waqf forests will guarantee the sustainability of the forest because this process makes waqf forest legal under Islamic law and the law of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, University of Indonesia Faculty of Law.

Design/methodology/approach: The study mainly applied the commonly used Tuckman and Chang’s (1991) model to measure the financial health of non-profits. Content and ratio analysis of the 2014 audited reports of seven institutions were used to determine their equity balance, revenue concentration, administrative costs and operating margin ratios. Findings: The results indicate that only one waqf institution was financially sustainable in all the four components. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used are not the latest and focussed only on a single year, the findings may not be necessarily true, currently. Second, the study focussed only on Malaysia. Thus, the results may not be generalisable to other waqfs in other countries or to privately managed waqf institutions. Accordingly, future research should address these limitations. Practical implications: The findings provide useful insights into the financial sustainability of waqf institutions and highlight the need for policymakers in Malaysia and other Muslim countries to give due attention to the holistic accountability of waqf institutions to ensure waqf’s systematic revival. Originality/value: The paper, being the first to investigate the financial sustainability and vulnerability of state waqf institutions in Malaysia, serves as a reference for future researchers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We are aware that conventional microfinance products have flourished in India; however, these products do not fulfil the needs of all Muslim clients. Taking small glimpses of Islamic microfinance (IMF), we can say it is working successfully in Muslim countries. From the meta-analysis we classify the literature into seven categories, viz. social benefits, religious values, business enterprises, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, rural development and economic development. The contribution of research papers has risen across the literature review and there has been a sharp rise in new facts pertaining to Islamic microfinance in India. As a diagnostic check, all seven factors of the meta-analysis of IMF contain evidence for the case study of India. Bait-un-Nasr is an urban co-operative credit society, located in Mumbai, India that has practised all of the factors extracted by the meta-analysis. This paper provides a roster of emerging projects accompanied by a comprehensive review of literature that will be useful to both academicians and practitioners for studying existing research and contemporary future research. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Islamic MFIs, which follow Shariah principles in their operations, aim not only to provide financing, but also to improve the socioeconomic conditions of poor people. There is heightened interest in the factors influencing the development of MFIs, such as relationship lending. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of such lending and the uniqueness of the implementation of social purpose in Islamic MFIs. The paper adopts a quantitative methodology, using cross-sectional survey data from 1,001 microloan borrowers from five MFIs, three of which are Islamic MFIs which provided financing in 13 regions in Indonesia in 2018. The results show that Islamic MFIs do not differ in the implementation of relationship lending. Furthermore, there is a likelihood that they are able to be more focused on profit-oriented transactions ensuring sustainability, due to their unique characteristics, as they have Baitul Maal with the social instruments of zakat, infaq and sadaqa to provide social-oriented transactions to improve outreach to the poor. The study enhances our understanding and adds knowledge to the existing literature on Islamic MFIs, especially in Indonesia. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

Acknowledging the superiority of green Sukuk to raise funds to mitigate climate change, the World Bank took the lead to promote it globally by making Malaysia the premier green Sukuk hub. This study seeks to assess the development of green Sukuk from the aspect of issuance and Shariah principle used in Malaysia since its inception in 2014. The study reveals that the development in the green Sukuk market is slow but is robust in moving from the energy industry to the building industry, while Shariah contracts used are based on the issuers' underlying assets. The study concludes that the green Sukuk market is still small and liquidity constraint makes it difficult for investors to gain access. For the government to increase green Sukuk issuance, information about the performance, challenges, risks, and opportunities in the realm of green Sukuk must be made available to both issuers and investors. © 2019, Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze data from 489 owner and nonowner executives of 150 family SMEs using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling). Findings: The authors found evidence that family involvement in business positively impacts the sustainable survival of family SMEs while corporate social responsibility partially mediates this relationship. Apart from effective family involvement in business, active involvement in social causes enhances a firm's ability to survive longer. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted in a geographic context and data were collected from family-managed and controlled firms. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to all types of family firms in the global context. In an Islamic society, family firms need to invest in social causes, human development, and environmental sustainability through zakat, sadaqat, and donations. Practical implications: The findings imply that family firms require stakeholder-centric competitive strategies and socially responsible behavior along with effective family control, commitment, enrichment, and successful succession since the path to sustainable survival goes through CSR. Originality/value: Survival is the biggest challenge facing family SMEs forcing them to achieve the ability to sustain longer. Rooted in transaction cost economics (TCE) theory of the family firm and stakeholder theory, this paper validates an integrative model for family SMEs' sustainable survival. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Specifically, this study intends to measure the differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat and measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The response to these issues, the study estimates the value of the Human Development Index (HDI) at a minor level; the individual and household levels. 100 recipients of zakat (mustahik) from the three programs of zakat distribution by the zakat institution of Aceh Province, Indonesia (Baitul Mal Aceh - BMA) were selected as the sample of the study using a combination of purposive and proportionate stratified random samplings. These zakat programs include zakat for cancer and thalassemia patients, zakat for one family one undergraduate scholarship, and zakat for buying working capital for the poor families. The paired t-test is adopted to assess the differences in HDI of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat, while the multiple linear regression is used to measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The study found that, after receiving zakat, the HDI of zakat recipients is higher than before. Zakat is also recorded to have a significant positive effect on the HDI, while the family size affected negatively the HDI and the types of zakat and profession of zakat recipients have an insignificant effect on the HDI. These findings suggest the positive role of zakat in improving human development and it could be used as one of the instruments to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs agenda in Indonesia. © 2020 Hellenic Association of Regional Scientists.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between ethical values and performance in the context of the banking sector in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the philanthropic model, this study posits that firms undertaking zakat and charity are ethical firms. Zakat disclosure index (ZDI) and charity disclosure index (CDI) were constructed to measure ethical values. This study hypothesises that ethical values are positively associated with bank performance. Ethical values (i.e. CDI and ZDI) and financial performance data (i.e. return on assets) were collected from the disclosures made in the annual reports of 50 banks for a period of five years (2010-2014). Findings: A positive association was found between zakat disclosure and bank performance. The results indicate that higher zakat disclosure is associated with greater bank performance. However, no relationship was found between charity disclosure and bank performance. Research limitations/implications: Considering the limitation of the index used in this study, other dimensions such as corporate governance, sustainability, products and environment can be considered in the development of index to measure ethical values in future studies. Originality/value: This study offers additional explanation on the relationship between ethical values and performance by examining the role of zakat disclosures that characterize the unique aspects of Malaysian companies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, women are the main beneficiaries of Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil (BMT), Indonesia’s first IMFIs. This paper aims to explore the origins, the initiators, and the visions of BMTs and the extent to which they intersect with women’s empowerment. Employing a qualitative approach, this study selected four BMTs in Yogyakarta as a case study. It found that four critical groups that have a significant role in the development of Indonesian BMTs: ICMI (Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectual), Islamic mass organizations, NGOs, and local governments. The issues of loan sharks and poverty alleviation were the primary factors driving the inception of BMTs. Despite women being crucial clients, none of the studied BMTs explicitly invoked women’s empowerment in their organizational vision. To conclude, the BMTs’ preference for women is not based on an understanding of gender inequality, but rather motivated by pragmatic business considerations, particularly the self-sustainability paradigm that underpins their practices. © 2020, MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

Almost 98.5 percent of business establishments in Malaysia are SME companies cut across all sizes and sectors. However, SMEs in Malaysia are unable to access external financing due to excessive, rigid procedures imposed by financial institutions and government agencies. To address and resolve this critical issue, with the advance of technology, entrepreneurs have become more independent and creative in raising capital through a process known as crowdfunding. This study intends to examine the role of Islamic crowdfunding towards SMEs sustainability in order to assist their financing need for business expansion or start-up in Malaysia. Furthermore, this study will empirically test the influence of strategic competitiveness and technology adoption on SMEs' sustainability. Primary data are collected using a self-administered questionnaire from a sample of 259 SMEs in Selangor. The data was computed using SmartPLS-3.2.8 to examine the direct effect on SME's sustainability. The findings show that Islamic crowdfunding, technology adoption and strategic competitiveness influenced the SME's sustainability.

The research method comes from previous studies to compare the capitalist, socialist, and sharia economic systems. In response to various economic uncertainties, both internal and external, the ability to seize opportunities and transform has become the key to economic resilience. Islamic economics can be an alternative in responding to the dynamics of the global and national economy. Several things need to be taken into consideration in fulfilling the sharia economy and the primary strategy chosen must come from the inputs given by the stakeholders, including business actors, associations, regulators as well as experts, and academicians. The primary strategy in implementing the sharia economy also requires the support of various parties in order to develop sustainability. Strengthening regulation and governance is one of the fundamental factors. Optimization of the sharia economy based social sector such as Zakat, Infaq, Sadaqah, and Waqaf can be optimized both for collection and distribution so that the concept of sharing can certainly support the development and the economy both nationally and globally. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

The financial performance is measured by Islamic specific financial performance, including profit sharing financing ratio, zakat performance ratio, equitable distribution ratio, and director employee welfare ratio. The ISR disclosure is measured based on the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic financial (AAOIFI) Governance Standard (GS) 1 and GS 7, consisting of 75 components of exposure in Islamic banks from Indonesia and Malaysia for the 2014-2018 period. This study uses regression analysis. From the analysis of the 90 annual reports, it was found that the level of ISR disclosure in Indonesia and Malaysia had diversity and superiority respectively over the dimensions of ISR disclosure. The content analysis results show that Indonesian Islamic banks have an average total superior exposure of 54% compared to Malaysian state Islamic banks of 47%. Regression tests prove a positive association between profit-sharing financial ratio and zakat performance ratio and the level of ISR disclosure. While the association between the equitable distribution ratio and director employee welfare ratio and the level of ISR disclosure is not proven. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This study attempted to highlight the core issue of fiscal imbalance in developing economies and its impact on a sustainable environment. For this purpose, the study utilized generalized least squares (GLS) and quantile autoregressive distributive lag (QARDL) on a 19-year dataset (2000–2018) of the South Asian region. The results of GLS indicate that fiscal imbalance contributing positively to South Asia’s environmental degradation process. Here, energy consumption (due to dirty sources of energy) and energy intensity (due to inefficient energy conversion technology) are also sources of environmental degradation in this region. The results of QARDL confirm that economic and political fluctuations can be the long-run source of fiscal imbalance in this region, which ultimately slows down the process of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory and contributes positively to environmental degradation. Based on the empirical analysis, this study provides a comprehensive set of policy guidance for developing and developed economies for the smooth transition of sustainable environmental conditions in South Asia. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Likewise, it is necessary to increase economic growth to make every sector of the economy safer and to reduce the level of dependency ratio and poverty in the districts/cities of Aceh Province. It is necessary to optimize the distribution of Zakat so that it is effective and efficient to reduce the dependency ratio and poverty in the long term.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Conventional microfinance institutions (MFIs) can promote financial inclusion, but they also prompt ethical concerns regarding the social consequences of commercialization and high interest rates. Islamic MFIs, which adhere to Sharia's prohibition of riba (usually interpreted as a ban on interest), present an alternative. Differences between conventional and Islamic MFIs in terms of outreach and financial sustainability remain underexplored; no comprehensive data set details Islamic MFIs either. With new data, collected with a global survey, the authors construct a unique panel of 543 conventional and 101 Islamic MFIs, operating in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. These data suggest that the market for Islamic microfinance is more important than previously recognized, has grown in recent years, and is likely to continue growing in every region of the world. Statistical comparisons, using various estimation techniques, regarding the outreach and financial performance of Islamic and conventional MFIs also reveal that the breadth and depth of Islamic MFIs exceed those of conventional MFIs, though conventional MFIs achieve stronger financial performance. This latter result is not robust though. © 2020 The Authors},

Design/methodology/approach: This research uses quantitative methods with a measurement model of Sustainability Livelihood Impact Assessment (SLIA). Findings: The results showed that the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program had quite an impact on the increase in Mustahik Community Assets. This is seen from the increase in 5 (five) SLIA assets with a variant value of 1.09 points. The highest increase occurred in Social Assets with a variant value of 1.25. Meanwhile, the lowest increase was in Natural Assets with a variant value of 0.93 points. For Financial Assets, there was an increase in changes with a variant value of 1.19, which shows the high impact of the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program on increasing the income of mustahik families. This increase was influenced by the sale of organic fertilizer and compost processed from goat manure. The aspect of vulnerability that can affect the Tanah Datar Livestock Center is a fairly high outbreak of livestock disease which results in the death of the mother and child during childbirth. Originality/value: Originality / value: The authenticity of this study is to assess the impact of zakat on the beneficiary's mustahik.

The study unconventionally analyzes the effect of macrolevel data on microlevel data on district level of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Microlevel data are utilized from a renowned national survey, Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) from which the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been computed, whereas the macrolevel data have been collected from Zakat & Usher Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Based on the nature of nested data set, we have used a multilevel model to counter intra-class correlation. The findings confirmed and validated that the novel aspect of the zakat negatively affects the multidimensional poverty and portray significant contribution in targeting several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Pakistan. Based on the empirical evidence, Zakat being as an obligatory arm which equips individuals to fulfill their necessities, this paper suggests necessary strategies toward zakat disbursement. The mechanism should be refined to stimulate economic growth and pursue SDGs via financial empowerment of less advantaged class of society by reducing poverty in developing countries like Pakistan. Moreover, the methodology adopted in the study opens doors for more enabling and conducive research practices in order to decompose the results and design policies accordingly. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd},

The object under study is a waqf managed by the Muhammadiyah Regional Board (PDM) of Lumajang East Java, Indonesia; a gas station business unit called SPBU Shirkah Amānah. PDM of Lumajang is taken as the subject of research because it has succeeded in managing profitable and productive waqf in business entities, and is playing a role in the community's economic empowerment. In this study, the data is collected through interviews, document reviews, and observations. The findings of this study show that creative innovation in developing productive waqf both in the form of business entities and business cooperation models conducted by PDM of Lumajang can generate a significant contribution in opening new jobs and investment. Further, it can also increase the community's financial income, increase social service facilities, and provide financial contribution to the sustainability of religious and social activities. Accordingly, it is argued that this productive waqf is likely able to play a significant role in the empowerment of the community's economy and might also be adapted to be a pilot model for productive waqf management. © 2021.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the role of Waqf as a means of enhancing financial inclusion and socio-economic justice in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology in this paper is that the data were elicited from secondary sources such as the Al-Qur’an, Hadiths and other empirical studies in the existing literature. The Tawhidi epistemology (Islamic world view) also has been obtained to deliver better understanding on the findings. Findings: The paper implores Islamic societies to take advantages of integrating Waqf to support the financing needs of disadvantaged members of the Muslims communities, especially the Muslims, dominated northern Nigeria with a high level of financial exclusion. The Waqf funds if integrated and institutionalized will support the region by making the fewer privilege members of that community-engaged thereby economically and enhancing the financial inclusion. This will also lead to economic growth and socio-economic development of Nigeria. Practical implications: The paper concludes by suggesting the establishment of Waqf funds to supports the less privileged people through Islamic Microfinance as means of enhancing socio-economic justice in Nigeria’s Muslims’ communities, which is negatively affected by the high rate of financial exclusion and poverty. This paper also provides critical suggestions on the ways the integration of Waqf funds will contribute significantly towards assisting Nigeria in achieving its vision of reducing the financial exclusion rate and may foster inclusive growth and sustainable development. Originality/value: This paper is a conceptual study and, therefore, limited to the content of the existing literature. Hence, the future researchers may replicate and test it empirically for a more scientific justification regarding the roles of Waqf towards enhancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In the contemporary environment, developing countries are more focused on how economic factors can reasonably utilize technological advancement and carbon neutrality target as effective mechanisms in achieving sustainable production and consumption patterns. The effort to attain carbon neutrality target on natural environment in terms of lower carbon emission (CO2), haze pollution, and greenhouse gas (GHG) requires measures like the usage of non-renewable energy, ecological innovation, and environmental taxes. In doing so, this study considers the sustainability of China's natural environment in terms of CO2 emission, haze pollution through PM2.5, and greenhouse gas emission as well as factors like ecological innovation (ECO), environmental taxes (ERT), renewable energy, and globalization as the key determinants. The Quantile ARDL approach was used to examine both long- and short-run relationships between the explanatory and outcome variables. The results confirmed that there is a significant and negative impact of ECO, renewable energy, and ERT on CO2 emission in the region of China under different quantiles. Whereas, the globalization factor was observed as positively and significantly linked with CO2 emission but only for the higher quantiles. The long-run estimation further showed that ECO, renewable energy, and ERT can significantly help to decrease haze pollution in terms of PM2.5 in China. Furthermore, QARDL also confirms the negative and long-run estimation between the ECO, REN, and ERT, whereas globalization is causing more GHG in China, subsequently creating more environmental sustainability issues. Thus, it is concluded that effective innovation, renewable energy consumption, and environmental taxes reduce carbon emission while globalization increases the carbon emission in the country. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Adverse changes in environmental conditions due to unprecedented industrialization have been attracting the attention of policymakers, researchers, and activists. For developing nations like Pakistan, sustainability issues become even more severe because of unplanned growth and lack of resources. In this study, we have applied the QARDL model to analyze the impact of renewable energy, institutional quality, tourism, and GDP on the ecological footprint in Pakistan from 1995 to 2017. The results of this study suggest that increased utilization of renewable energy and tourism improve the environment in Pakistan, whereas institutional quality and GDP are positive and significant at all quantiles, revealing that upsurge in GDP and institutional quality are directly related to environmental conditions at all the quantiles. These results also validate the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve in Pakistan. The government of Pakistan can play a notable part in attaining sustainability by efficient management of the environment through promoting sustainable tourism, utilization of renewable energy, and enhancement of institutional quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This is in line with the United Nations’ 2030 ambitions to strengthen and advance human society’s sustainable development. Goal number 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), goal number 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and goal number 13 (Climate Action) are highly correlated to each other. The current study investigates the role of human capital and technological innovation in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) through a carbon-free energy system. A 19-year dataset covering the years 2000−2018 for the G7 economies has been utilized by using the composite index, Multicriteria decision analysis, and Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) methods. The study’s outcomes indicate that the human capital index and technological innovations contribute positively to SDGs in G7 economies. Both indicators also contribute positively to the carbon-free economy by contributing to carbon-free energy sources. The financial index and energy index results also indicate a positive association with the carbon-free economy in G7 nations. This study suggests policy guidelines for developed as well as for developing economies based on human capital and technological innovation to fulfill the SDGs. © 2021 by the authors.

According to the analysis, economic growth is positively and significantly associated with carbon dioxide emissions. The study also validates the EKC hypothesis in the case of Pakistan. Moreover, we found that technological innovation and renewable energy are negatively associated with the environmental degradation. This relationship is significant at all the quantiles. Our analysis shows that globalization is also an important source to bring an increase in CO2 emissions in Pakistan. Our empirical analysis also supports the negative role of cleaner energy for mitigating emissions in the short-term. The results from Granger causality also reveal the bidirectional causality from GDP, Innovation, and renewable energy to carbon dioxide emissions, however, there exists a unidirectional causality from GDP to globalization for Pakistan.

This is in line with the existence of regulations that support the effectiveness of its role in poverty reduction in Indonesia, such as Law No. 23 of 2011 on Zakat Management and Law No. 41 of 2004 on Waqf. This study has two objectives. First, to analyze the impact of Islamic philanthropy on poverty reduction as the socio-economic problems in Indonesia in the short and long run. Second, to analyze the effectiveness of integrated Islamic commercial and social-economic or finance to address the poverty compared to unintegrated one. This study used Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to analyze annual data for the period of 2002-2019 while investigating the long and short-run relationships among variables. It found that Islamic philanthropy reduces poverty both in the short and long run, particularly in the integration of Islamic social and commercial finance in a single model. The government should therefore include Islamic philanthropy or other Islamic social finances as a fundamental strategy for building financial stability and sustainable development.

Therefore, this paper proposes the Conceptual Framework of Sustainable Tahfiz Model (STM), which integrates three main scopes, i.e., Rainwater Harvesting System (RWHS), Renewable Energy Strategies (RES) and Food Subsistence Strategies (FSS). The nexus of such a green approach requires an ecological footprint in producing and consuming food through a series of connections between energy and clean water. Evidently, this is an alternative in maximizing existing resources and at the same time to generate extra income for PTIs in Malaysia to improve their sustainability.

These activities lead to remarkable benefits and prosperity, which can be treated as religious, social goals and revenue creation for the receiver and the donor. Several types of research have been done on the factors of people contributing to voluntary giving and factors of the rejection. There has been no complete study found on how to cultivate the Islamic Philanthropy, although there are eternal rewards ascertained in Islam. To fill this gap, this paper focusses on the effort of developing a Systematic Education-Professional (Edu-Pro) Model to jet-boost participation and sustainability of Islamic Philanthropy in the era of the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0). A qualitative method is used in analysing and synthesizing the relevant literature and document review to develop this model from the framework of Maqasid Shariah, together with the combination of accelerating rapid growth of the world technologies and digitalization. This theoretical study examines the Quranic verses and theories from scholars to support this model. The aspect of education will also be zoomed in to ensure that this model is developed systematically and professionally. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

A Tawhidic concept premised on the Quran and Sunnah was used to underpin the development of the proposed corporate waqf model. Content analyses of existing academic literature on Waqf, followed by preliminary semi-structured interviews on groups of Chief Executive Officers, SIRC officers, Islamic Scholars and Academics, were conducted. The key challenges faced by waqf organisations are as follows: i) the development of waqf properties is not economical; and ii) the current waqf model does not support the wealth creation, wealth enhancement and wealth distribution to the ummah. These weaknesses have motivated this study to propose a new corporate waqf model; one that encompasses an enhanced governance structure and management setting. This new model treats waqf as an effective mechanism that can strengthen the economic growth of Malaysia. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

However, provision of access and services to lower-level households can potentially conflict with the sustainability of the institutions. This study analyses the social outreach factors that determine financial and social efficiencies. To reach the set goal and solve this issue, we used mixed methodology combining quantitative (statistical instruments, such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and multivariate analysis) and qualitative approaches (interviews to clarify or deepen the existing information). The assessment of the dependent variables is influenced by proxies of depth, breadth, length, scope, and cost. The results showed that the average loan instalments and the number of offices and branches significantly influence financial and social efficiency. The age of the institution only has an effect on financial efficiency. Simultaneously, profit orientation, the amount and type of financing and the amount and type of savings only have a high impact on social efficiency, whereas the impact of fund collection and cost per borrower is insignificant. There is a strong positive correlation between the two dependent variables. The influence of independent variables on financial and social efficiency is significant with the coefficient of determination 23.1274 % and 53.2941 %, respectively. © 2020 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

This research utilizes the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method. This approach is useful as it depicts the causality patterns through various quantiles of the globalization and environmental degradation by providing more comprehensive explanations of the over-all dependence among the aforementioned variables almost ignored by the traditional approach (for instance ARDL and OLS). The outcomes of QARDL showed that the error correction coefficient is significant with the anticipated negative sign for all quantiles. This outcome provides evidence on the presence of considerable return to the long-run equilibrium association between the factors of interest and environmental degradation. Overall, the results recommended that overall globalization and economic globalization enhance the level of environmental degradation in the long run, however, political and social globalization help to reduce the level of environmental degradation in the long term. Moreover, the results of QARDL also confirmed the existence of inverted U-Shape curve in the Malaysian economy. In the shorter-run period, this study found a significant negative impact of overall globalization and political globalization on environmental degradation. The results recommended that the Malaysian government and policymakers need to give more attention to social and political globalization to achieve the goals of sustainable environment in the long-run equilibrium. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent research has shown a huge impact of non-renewable energy (NRE) production on environmental health. In this context, this work analyzes the effects of GDP growth and long- and short-term consumption of renewable and non-renewable energy (RE and NRE, respectively) on carbon emission in BRICS and OECD economies. The quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model was employed on the panel data from 1980 to 2016. Findings suggest a negative GDP-carbon emission correlation and a positive NRE-carbon emission correlation in the considered economies. Furthermore, carbon emission decreases with increase in gross capital formation, whereas trade openness does not have any significant effect on carbon emission. It has been determined that the application of the error correction method (ECM) has less effect on energy consumption as compared to the past levels and changes in energy consumption. In the long-term, a positive correlation of carbon emission and energy consumption is observed, whereas limited short-term effects of energy consumption on carbon emission are observed. Therefore, an RE-based energy production approach is recommended in the selected region for the future projects. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Several previous studies state that the Islamic Social Finance program has not fully succeeded in creating prosperity, and there are no definite measurements to show the sustainability impact of the program. Thus, a measurement is needed to analyze various aspects in achieving the success and sustainability of Islamic social finance programs. This study developed an index for performance evaluation with an emphasis on the success and sustainability of the Islamic Social Finance program. The study used the Analytical Network Process to determine and analyze priority components. Furthermore, the Multistage Weighted Index method was used to calculate the final index score. The index was built by taking into consideration various factors, stakeholders, aspects, and indicators. This study indicates that aspects of funding contribution from donors (0.22), involvement of donors in giving advice (0.99), and controlling of supervisor (0.08) are priority aspects in the success and sustainability of the program. An empirical investigation was performed on three different programs in Indonesia: A, B, and C. Program A (0.81) and C (0.80) have succeeded in improving the beneficiaries' quality of life to the level of economic resilience, although at a low level of sustainability (76-84.33). On the other hand, program B (0.73) is at the economic reinforcement and has not yet achieved sustainability. This index can be seen as a comprehensive tool for measuring the success and sustainability of the program at several levels. © 2022 Widiastuti et al.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on presenting a working model by combining the concepts of Waqf and smart Sukuk that works under the contract of Ijarah. Therefore, it can be referred to as a waqf based Ijarah Smart Sukuk model. In a study conducted by Che Zuina Ismail (2015), it is found that due to several reasons such as bureaucracy and lack of transparency in waqf administration, Waqf has lost much of its dynamism. Due to these reasons and several others, many waqf properties are either lying idle or in a dilapidated condition, which has led to Awqaf's effectiveness and role being questioned. There is a need to broadly advertise the significant role played by Awqaf as an instrument of social welfare. Hence, this model is suggested for the development of waqf properties and to revive the role of Waqf in society's social well-being. By using the qualitative method, this paper also highlights the issues or challenges involved in the practical application of the smart Sukuk or Ijarah contract, including possible Shari'ah issues. The paper's policy implication suggests that the states adopt this technologically advanced and Shari'ah compliant working model to target the development-related issues of waqf properties. This paper will also offer the existing and upcoming professionals in Islamic finance a broader perspective about smart Sukuk and hopefully encourages them to develop a favourable framework for smart Sukuk and other smart contracts, which is currently lacking. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, several environmental issues threaten China's long-term viability, including rising energy consumption, reliance on coal, and worsening air pollution. Therefore, the present research is conducted for Revisiting Resources Curse Hypothesis in China by identifying any asymmetric impact and the non-linear relationship between Natural Resources (NTR), Green Investment (GIV), and Green Innovation (GIN) on Financial Development (FDV) through QARDL model, which has allowed a thorough examination of the problem at varying quantiles. The findings of the QARDL validated the presence of the Resource Curse hypothesis. Additionally, the effects of NTR with the quantiles of FDV yielded negative relationships, GIV with the quantiles of FDV yielded positive relationships, and GIN with the quantiles of FDV yielded positive relationships. Based on the findings, it is recommended that China develop strategies and achieve sustainable growth to enjoy the benefits of FDV and economic growth without hampering the environmental goals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Indonesia relies heavily on palm oil production to meet the expanding demand for inexpensive vegetable oil. Approximately nine percent of the annual rise in palm oil production can be attributed to the rising demand for biofuels. However, the oil palm business has been connected to severe environmental issues, such as peatland mismanagement, biomass burning, and deforestation, which produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and contribute to climate change and global warming. Consequently, the present study aims to empirically examine the effects of palm oil production on environmental pollution, namely CO2 emissions in Indonesia from 1990 to 2020, while controlling for energy consumption, economic growth, and agricultural production. Applying the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (QARDL) for empirical evaluation, this study evaluates the influence of oil output at different quantiles. According to the study, long-term palm oil production has a considerable and favorable effect on CO2 emissions in the lower to middle quantiles (0.05th to 0.7th quantiles). In the short term, the impact of palm oil production is significant and positive across all quantile levels. The post-estimation Wald Test and Granger Causality Test at quantiles suggest that bidirectional causality exists between all of the study variables, confirming the consistency of the parameters. The findings advise the implementation of proper management of the oil palm crop by the Indonesian government. Green management policies and environmental standards are encouraged by the government of Indonesia to have sustainable growth and development of the oil palm sector. © 2022 AgBioForum},

Climate change, the growth of the Islamic finance industry, and the rise of socially responsible investing could make green Sukuk a vital tool for financing clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects. Many studies have identified its potential and advantages. However, no companies have issued green corporate Sukuk in Indonesia yet. The purpose of this study is to determine the potential and main problems of issuing corporate green Sukuk in Indonesia, along with possible solutions and strategies. The research method used is the analytic network process (ANP). In this study, respondents are experts in the field of green Sukuk (involved experts were from academia, project actors, and regulators). The results of the study indicate that the first destination that has the potential to be financed with green corporate Sukuk is renewable energy. At the same time, the main problem is the lack of understanding from market participants. In terms of solutions, the incentive provided by the government is the best to encourage the issuance of green corporate Sukuk. Moreover, the first strategy is to issue green corporate Sukuk with ijarah contracts. From the research results, it is hoped that the Indonesian government can be more aggressive in providing incentives to green project actors. © Endri Endri, Bella Tahya Hania, Amir Ma’ruf, 2022.},

	abstract = {Concern about climate change is spreading around the globe. The urge to comprehend the environmental effects and take action is sharply rising. Regarding this, the banking industry has a great chance to offer a solution in terms of green financial solutions and can meet the needs of carbon-conscious organizations to combat and defend our planet. Therefore, in light of this, according to the greatest understanding of the authors, this is the first study to investigate the role of banking sector development, economic growth, and clean energy consumption in scaling up green finance investment in South Asian nations, taking carbon emissions, foreign direct investment, remittances, inflation, and trade openness as control variables. This study uses a novel residual augmented least squares—Engle and Granger (RALS-EG) co-integration to test the long-term link and the quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) econometric approach to extract the association across the quantiles (q0.05–q0.95) for the period 2000–2020. The outcomes of QARDL show that banking sector development, economic growth, clean energy, carbon emissions, foreign direct investment, remittances, and trade openness play a positive role in attracting green finance in the long term. However, only inflation has a negative influence on scaling up finance in South Asian nations. Therefore, the concerned authorities (government, central banks, environmentalists, and policymakers) are urged to implement green finance policies and strategies as suggested and recommended by the results of this study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The study leverages the novel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (QARDL) approach to integrate asymmetric patterns and address socio-economic shocks over the last three decades. The QARDL is advantageous for portraying environmental sustainability dependence patterns across diverse data distribution. The empirical findings reveal that NRR, FDP, and GDP positively influenced the carbon emission at higher and lower emissions quantiles. In contrast, green technology innovation significantly mitigates emissions across all quantiles. Notably, the influence of all regressors substantially varied across lower, medium, and higher emissions quantiles, suggesting in-depth insight into resource cruse and sustainable development in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This commitment gives Indonesia the right to take advantage of various types of support, including ICF opportunities offered by the ADB through the non-UNFCCC financial scheme and the Global Green Growth Institute through the UNFCCC financial mechanism. This paper explores to what extent ICF supports the achievement of Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. The study uses qualitative analysis to provide a general overview of ICF in Indonesia, its climate finance strategies, and the case study of the energy sector. The study finds that ICF in Indonesia continues to develop, albeit with many limitations. Several ICF channels could be utilized more optimally such as, loan and grant instruments. Indonesia cannot rely solely on international support to meet its enormous climate finance needs; it must develop innovative financing through various instruments, such as green sukuk. ICF also plays a role in facilitating the energy transition from coal-based to renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency. © 2022},

It is the development of a conceptual paper that explores and carefully reviews regulations, relevant literature studies, reports, and official documents published on the internet. The findings showed that Indonesia has successfully formulated and issued two instruments for integrating cash waqf with the State Sukuk: the CWLS and Retail CWLS. These instruments involve six state institutions and eight central socio- religious institutions that act as formulation, implementation, and supervision. Both instruments are not only beneficial for Islamic social welfare, but they also contribute to the national development. The authors argue that the innovation of Islamic financial instruments can empower the Islamic social welfare and contribute to the national development. It contributes to the discourse on cash waqf innovations in State Sukuk which studies Indonesia's experiences. This evidence from Indonesia can be adopted and applied by other countries that have fiscal limitations for the empowerment of Islamic social welfare, and at the same time contribute to the national development. © (2023), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah).

The package of measures adopted by the EU in this context, outlines the importance of sustainable finance strategy, aimed at financing the transition towards a sustainable economy. A tool to enable the pursuit of this transition is Green Bond. The EU Commission launched a taxonomy proposal aimed at creating Green Bonds quality standards and certifications, because the existing industry standards are still based on definitions of green projects that are not sufficiently uniform, rigorous or comprehensive. The adoption of uniform universal standards for the definition of green projects could also contribute to stop “greenwashing”(the practice of falsely attributing green qualities to an investment which in reality does not possess them). For example a recent Italian decision (Alcantara vs Miko) stated that the rules for communication on sustainability are different from those on traditional advertising because sustainability should be real and not a façade. This study examines the possibility of a uniform adoption of standards at EU level and compares the European Green Bond standards with other similar initiatives, such as the Shari’ah-compliant Green Sukuk. © 2023 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) owners’ intentions to participate in waqf, involving two countries, which are Malaysia and Indonesia, using the theory of planned behavior. SMEs are the backbone of many economies, representing 95% of all companies worldwide and accounting for 60% of employment. Based on this fact, this paper analyzes the influence of religiosity, knowledge and attitude to predict the intentions of SMEs’ owners in waqf participation in Malaysia and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Data were randomly obtained from 175 SMEs owners from Malaysia and Indonesia with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) used for analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis data suggest that knowledge and attitude show a significant impact on the intentions of SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf, while religiosity does not have a significant impact on the intentions of Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf. Practical implications: This study aims to assist SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia to formulate appropriate strategies and marketing using waqf for the sustainability of SMEs which represent more than 90% of business establishments in both countries. The strategy is a necessity, especially because the government is targeting to promote a sustainable Islamic financial system, improve governance policy and halal industry for SMEs, strengthen the development of Malay Reserve land, providing as financial independence to higher learning institutions and invest in digitalization and advanced technology through waqf funds. Therefore, both countries should take the initiative to provide training to equip SMEs with extensive knowledge through multiple platforms to further encourage their participation in waqf. Originality/value: Because of the increasing interest in waqf participation both in Malaysia and Indonesia, this study claims three essential contributions. First, it aims to examine the intention of SMEs in waqf participation among the business owners in Malaysia and Indonesia. Second, the study findings are expected to benefit the development of literature in accordance with Islamic social finance, particularly waqf. Third, this study provides an insight into the inclusive knowledge and attitude of SME owners and their intention to participate in waqf. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

But, unfortunately, due to the absence of a universal standard of Waqf evaluation, the implementation of Waqf in Indonesia has not been optimal. Therefore, this study proposes the National Waqf Index (Indeks Wakaf Nasional or IWN) for improving the governance system and measuring waqf performance at national and regional levels. Through literature review and focus group discussion (FGD), this study develops six factors, namely regulatory (with three sub-factors), institution (with two sub-factors), process (with four sub-factors), system (with three sub-factors), outcome (with two sub-factors), and impact (with four sub-factors). Using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) involving experts from government, academic, and industry, this study finds that the priority of IWN is a regulatory factor (0.282) followed by institution factor (0.251), process factor (0.190), system factor (0.156), outcome factor (0.069), and impact factor (0.050). The findings from this study will strengthen the existing literature in Waqf and be used to develop the governance system to improve performance. © 2023 The Authors},

In this analysis, we have explored three determinants of green growth: green finance investment, technological capital, and renewable energy. Moreover, this study focuses on the asymmetric impact of green finance investment, technological progress, and renewable energy on green growth in China during the period spanning from 1996 to 2020. To get the asymmetric short and long-run estimates across various quantiles, we have employed the nonlinear QARDL. The long-run estimates attached to a positive shock in green finance investment, renewable energy demand, and technological capital are positively significant at most quantiles. While, the long-run estimates attached to a negative shock in green finance investment, technological capital, and renewable energy demand are insignificant at most quantiles. In general, the findings suggest that the rise in green financial investment, technological capital, and renewable energy demand positively impacts green growth in the long run.

To further enhance this process, digital waqf has emerged as an innovative solution. This study aims to analyze and investigate the determinants of Muslims' intention to use digital waqf, employing quantitative methods. Through the distribution of online questionnaires, a total of 304 respondents, specifically individuals involved in waqf and digital waqf, were randomly selected. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. The findings reveal that perceived usefulness and attitude exert a positive and significant influence on the intention to use digital waqf. However, perceived ease of use and perceived trust do not significantly impact the intention to use digital waqf. Notably, this study uncovers that social image, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust can enhance individuals' attitudes towards digital waqf. Among all the variables examined, perceived usefulness emerges as the most significant factor contributing to the intention to use digital waqf. © 2023, Success Culture Press. All rights reserved.},

The study applied the quantile autoregressive distributed lag approach during the period 1970–2018, along with Granger causality to explore dynamic and asymmetric causal associations between the proposed variables. The empirical outcomes indicate that the error correction parameters are significant across major quantiles, confirming the presence of steady-state equilibrium in the long run. The results demonstrate that tourism and transportation services contribute significantly to economic growth in the long run; however, their contribution varies at different quantiles. On the other hand, tourism and transportation services were found to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions mainly across higher emission quantiles, confirming the sustainability of the transportation and tourism sector in Malaysia. We also observe a bidirectional causality between model variables. These results suggest important policy implications. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;18:1272–1287. © 2021 SETAC. © 2021 SETAC.},

ISF institutions enjoy sufficient financial capacity to bridge the gaps and realize the most relevant and urgent SDGs. However, due to policies and other constraints, their participation in international development aid programs is limited. Accordingly, this study explores the existing policy divide between Western and Islamic countries regarding the use of Faith-Based funds in international humanitarian and development aid programs. Through case studies, this study demonstrates that ISF instruments have the potential at national and international levels to mobilize resources to support marginalized groups in society in various countries. The analysis indicates the need to develop a framework that helps to build cooperation among local and international actors to mobilize ISF funds for cross-country development and humanitarian aid, which accelerates the achievement of the SDGs. This paper studies ongoing dialogues among various stakeholders to create policy convergence and to use ISF instruments towards SDGs. This study suggests that the dialogue should be more inclusive by including all potential stakeholders, including Muslim leaders, policymakers and Shariah Scholars, to narrow policy gaps and to draw policy coherence for using ISF tools in the duality aid programs and for creating synergies towards achieving the SDGs. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Green sukuk is a contemporary-era sharia investment revolution that accommodates environmental aspects. Integrating Sustainable Financing in green sukuk can be an alternative investment platform contributing to sustainable development. The concept paradigm is relevant for strengthening the proportional construction of green sukuk law in Indonesia. The study aimed to analyze the concept of sustainable financing as the legal basis for implementing green sukuk in supporting sustainable development programs in Indonesia. The study used normative legal research methods. This research approach used a conceptual approach through reasoning the concepts of sustainable financing, green sukuk, and other concepts relevant to the topic of study to strengthen the discussion argument. The study showed that there are 2 (two) components of the relevance of the Sustainable Financing paradigm as the basis for implementing green sukuk in Indonesia. First, the implementation of green sukuk in various countries has rules that accommodate sustainable financing in response to climate change problems. Second, the sustainable financing Paradigm is relevant as a source of green sukuk legal construction to strengthen the policy basis for implementing environmentally sound investment in Indonesia. The urgency of the regulation is to increase investment commitments that can increase environmental resilience, alleviation of social problems and business transparency in contributing to sustainable development in Indonesia. © 2023, Sharia Faculty of State Islamic Institute (IAIN) Palangka Raya.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to devise policies in implementing cash waqf system of Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT) in Indonesia, enabling the BMT to optimize its commercial and social activities to better achieve outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST) method, with three groups of knowledgeable respondents, including expert, BMT practitioner and regulator to formulate important and certain policies. Findings: The results show that four types of policies are required to improve cash waqf system of BMT, including 12 internal strategic policies, 15 internal operational policies, 15 external strategic policies and 9 external operational policies, which were found to be within a “certain planning region.” All of these policies have been agreed significantly by each group of respondents, as well as by all respondents combined. The most important-certain policies include Shiddiq, Amanah and professional Nazir, inculcate Islamic values to BMT employees and members, standard operating procedure and standard operating management of cash waqf management, technical assistance for Nazir to manage cash waqf and IT systems for BMT-cash waqf administration. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative method used has its limitations, which could be improved by incorporating other methods. Moreover, the case and respondents are all Indonesian, so that the results are possibly only applicable to BMTs in Indonesia. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt these policies in implementing their cash waqf management optimally. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help improve the social activities of the Baitul Maal directly from social cash waqf and indirectly from productive cash waqf. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study using SAST method to determine policies needed by the BMT to upgrade its cash waqf management producing more social programs for the society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This research used a qualitative approach to increase financial performance and sustainability. The study population comprised the Baitut Tamwil Muhammadiyah (BTM) in Central Java Province, Indonesia. The data collection techniques included questionnaires and an in-depth interview, and the framework was validated by the main participants. Findings: This study showed that BTMs have implemented risk management using different standards. However, such risk management is carried out partially while prioritising certain risks and using different methods. The risk of Sharia compliance is the most recognised risk, while financing and operational risks are the most anticipated, because these two risk types directly impact financial performance and sustainability. In general, a risk management model can improve financial performance and sustainability. Nevertheless, there are obstacles in implementing risk management at BTMs, which include weak human resources, the employee selection process, human resource development and a good control system. Originality/value: This research explored best practices for risk management in IMFIs and may contribute to the development of risk management in such institutions to maintain the financial performance and sustainability of their services. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of Islamic social finance (ISF) instruments such as Zakah, Sadaqah and Waqf in the provision of social services by Islamic faith-based organizations (IFBOs) in Southwest Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts exploratory approach based on field interviews conducted with leaders of IFBOs, whereas purposive sampling technique was used to select three case study organizations. Data collected from interviews and documents of case study organizations was analyzed using content and narrative analyses. Findings: The first findings indicate faith in the Unseen God, scriptural texts and socio-economic factors as major motivation that accounted for the IFBOs’ concern for social services. The second finding shows that the ISF strategies used by the IFBOs to improve access to social services include Zakah, Awqaf, Sadaqah and gifts. The third finding reveals that the IFBOs have efficient stand-alone and windows operational structures that align with IFBOs corporate governance. The fourth finding also reveals the challenges facing the IFBOs such as inadequate funding, dearth of manpower, lukewarm and uncooperative attitude of Muslims and attitudinal behaviour of givers and takers. Research limitations/implications: Absence of documented directory about the role IFBOs usage of ISF in providing social services in Southwest Nigeria affected the study. Many IFBOs were eliminated during the process of selection because of lack of records to indicate their social services relevant to the study. As such, information that could have been collected from the eliminated IFBOs could have contributed significantly to the study. Practical implications: The major implications of the study are that ISF has been reinvented as an ethical social welfare framework for supporting the disadvantaged members of the society with ISF instruments and also highlighted the dichotomy existing between IFBOs in the North and Southwest Nigeria with respect to the legal and operational activities of IFBOs usage of ISF. Originality/value: This study has contributed to a better understanding of the role of ISF instruments in the provision of social services in an area that is largely under-researched in Nigeria. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The overall results reveal that environmental technology and clean energy investments have a negative employment impact in the short-run and long-run, while environmental technology’s significance is high in the short-run only. It implies that environmental technology and clean energy investments create ample job opportunities in China’s energy sector and significantly address the growing unemployment issue.

	abstract = {Tourism has become an increasingly significant contributor to economic growth in Asia. However, the rapid expansion of the tourism industry has also raised concerns about its impact on the environment and economic sustainability. Meanwhile, the structural transformation of economies in Asia has also been a major factor in shaping the region’s environmental and economic performance. Thus, the present study aims to explore the impact of the tourism industry and structural change on green economic and environmental performance in Asia. Limited empirical evidence exists on the impact of tourism industry and structural change on CO2 emissions and green growth. The objective of this current study is to examine how tourism industry and structural change impact green economic and environmental performance over the period 1993 to 2020. For analyzing short- and long-run results across different quantiles, we have employed a nonlinear QARDL model that can provide estimates across different quantiles. The findings of the CO2 emissions model imply that long-term improvements in tourism and structural changes significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In contrast, the long-term negative changes in tourism and structural changes increase CO2 emissions. In the green growth model, long-term improvements in tourism and structural changes significantly improve green growth; however, the long-term decline in tourism and structural changes significantly reduce green growth. Moreover, the control variable of ICT reduces CO2 emissions and improves green growth, and energy consumption increases CO2 emissions and reduces green growth. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, its management has not been seen optimally even though BAZNAS has been designated as the official agency and the only non-structural government agency that manages zakat. This study aims to investigate the important role of the human generation who are members of the Muslim community in collecting zakat at the BAZNAS in the era of digital society 5.0 to realize the SDGs. This study uses a literature study method with library data collection techniques, reading and taking notes, and managing research materials by tracing written sources that have been previously written. This study uses content analysis techniques to obtain written information that focuses on four dimensions, namely human generation, Muslim community, zakat collection, and sustainable development goals. The findings reveal that two generations of humans are members of the Muslim community that have the potential to increase zakat collection. Deeper, Maqāṣid shari'āh as the essence of Islamic law through the values of justice, freedom, and human rights of the Muslim community will support the goal of collecting zakat. The novelty of this research found that building the strength and glory of BAZNAS in the era of digital society 5.0 requires strong social ties from the entire Muslim generation community, especially the younger generation community. The main contribution of this research highlights the ‘zakat movement' led by BAZNAS to pay more attention to the role of the millennial Muslim generation community and iGeneration in supporting zakat empowerment programs to realize Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023, Institut Agama Islam Negeri Batusangkar.

	abstract = {The current paradigms of Islamic economics and finance lead to comprehensive sustainability performance that considers Islamic Sharia goals. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review focusing on assessing the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs) through various model measurements from a global perspective published in reputable international journals until 2023. The authors have applied several literature review techniques, including bibliometric citation and content analysis, to review past studies. The collected manuscripts comprise 52 papers published from 2008 to 2023, categorized into various research topics. The results indicate that research on sustainability performance in the Islamic finance sector is still scarce, despite experiencing a fairly fluctuating increase. The highest number of publications was in the year 2023, with a total of 11 papers (19%) out of the overall publications. The findings from our research show that existing studies have used a variety of techniques to measure the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs). The review highlights that the most frequently utilized models in measuring the sustainability of Islamic microfinance institutions use qualitative approaches. However, 37% of articles within the collection employ quantitative measurements. Previous research generally considers financial and social aspects or spiritual dimensions as separate elements.  © 2023 IEEE.},

However, having only recently come into existence has its own set of challenges for this tool that require immediate identification and government intervention to intensify its growth. This study aims to explore the challenges encountered by green sukuk issuers and the structure of a reconciled green sukuk issuance framework to speed up the market’s growth with the right interventions. Design/methodology/approach: The study engaged a qualitative approach via multiple case study interviews with green sukuk issuers and used expert views for data triangulation to generate the findings. A total of four green sukuk issuers participated in the interviews, and for data triangulation purposes, four expert’s opinions and views were considered. The thematic analysis technique is used to report the findings. Findings: It was revealed that amongst the challenges encountered in the green sukuk market are shoddy green taxonomy, difficulty in identifying green assets, it is time-consuming and costly, no compelling benefits and exposure to higher-risk profiles. Research limitations/implications: This study may be influenced by observer error and observer bias. However, the researchers have taken cautious steps to overcome these issues by following strict case study methodology procedures and triangulating the qualitative research findings with views from green sukuk experts. These interventions increased the rigour and trustworthiness of the results. Originality/value: This study is amongst the pioneer in Malaysia, exploring challenges in the green sukuk market. The results are relevant to governments, regulators, institutions and central banks to structure the right interventions to counter the challenges. Greater government involvement is required to strengthen the green sukuk market and to spearhead the green agenda. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to investigate the impact of credit risk-taking on financial and social efficiency and examine the relationship between credit risk, capital structure and efficiency in the context of Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs) compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The stochastic frontier approach was used to estimate the financial and social efficiency scores, in a first step. In a second step, the impact of risk-taking on efficiency was evaluated. The authors also took into account the moderating role of capital structure in this effect using the fixed and random effects generalized least squares (GLS) with a first-order autoregressive disturbance. The used dataset covers 326 conventional MFIs and 57 Islamic MFIs in six different regions of the world over the period of 2005–2015. Findings: The overall average efficiency scores are less than 50%, where CMFIs could have produced their outputs using 48% of their actual inputs. IMFIs record the lowest financial (cost) efficiency that is equal to 28% on average. The estimation results also reveal a negative impact of nonperforming loan on financial and social efficiency. Finally, the moderating effect of leverage funding on the relationship between credit risk-taking and financial efficiency was confirmed in CMFIs. However, leverage seems to moderate the effect of risk-taking behavior on social efficiency for IMFIs. Originality/value: This paper makes an initial attempt to evaluate the effect of risk-taking decision and its implication on efficiency and MFIs' sustainability. Besides, it takes into consideration the role played by the mode of governance through the ownership structure. In addition, this research study sheds light on the importance of the financial support for the development and sustainability of these institutions, which in return, contributes to a sustainable economic development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Over the last three decades, the world has been facing the phenomenon of the ecological deficit as the ecological footprint is continuously rising due to the persistent decline of the per-capita bio-capacity. Moreover, there is a substantial increase in globalization and electricity consumption for the same period, and transportation is contributing to economic prosperity at the cost of environmental sustainability. Understanding the determinants of ecological footprint is thus critical for suggesting appropriate policies for environmental sustainability. As a result, this study analyzes the impacts of economic globalization, transportation, coal rents, and electricity consumption in ecological footprint in the context of the USA over the period 1995 to 2018. The data have been extracted from “Global Footprint Network,” “Swiss Economic Institute,” and “World Development Indicators.” The current study has also applied the flexible Fourier form nonlinear unit root test to examine the stationarity among variables. For the empirical estimation, a novel technique, the “quantile auto-regressive distributive lag model,” is applied in the study to deal with the nonlinear associations of the variables and to evaluate the long-term stability of variables across quantiles. The study’s findings indicate that coal rents, transportation, and globalization significantly and positively contribute to the deterioration of ecological footprints at different quantile ranges in the short and long run. Electricity consumption is found to have a positive and significant impact at lower quantile ranges in the long run but not have a significant impact in the short run. The study suggested that lowering the dependence of the transport sector on fossil fuels, more use of hydroelectricity, and stringent strategies to curb coal consumption would be helpful to reduce the positive influence of these variables on ecological footprints in the USA.

	abstract = {In this research, we present a framework for blended Islamic finance for impactful small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The blend results from discussing the pertinent perspectives that underlie the motives of philanthropy, private sector activities and public sector facilitation. The consensus of these three stakeholders on the impact criteria is an essential precondition for the blend to happen. Therefore, we first developed the consensus-based impact criteria for SMEs, namely, 4Zeros & SS (zero-waste, zero-emissions, zero-interest, zero-foreclosures and service to society). After that, we adopted a financial engineering approach to design products by blending the three motives. Financial contracts could be incentive compatible and effective if these three motivations are recognized and brought together. The purpose of our research is to offer such incentive-compatible structures that can mobilize funding for impactful SMEs, save cost as well as generate revenue for self-sustainability. In the contract design, the private sector provides finance, the philanthropist pays the costs of funds, the public sector facilitates, and the impactful SME gets subsidized financing. Since the blended nature of the contract provides a social subsidy to fund the cost element of the financing, the proposed structure creates a win-win result for the blending parties. While financial institutions expand into the SMEs sector for profitability, blended Islamic finance will attract additional resources toward enhancing development impact. Through the philanthropic component, SMEs, on the other hand, will access the source of social subsidy that will relieve the burden of the exorbitant commercial rates. The funding structure will reduce risk perception and spur growth. Consequently, this collaborative and innovative contract design will contribute to achieving multidimensional human development, as enshrined in the Maqasid al-Shariah, and the SDGs. Impactful businesses must integrate environmental, social and governance best practices as well as national development goals. Hence, the proposal offers several benefits and prospects of extended use for other consensus-based purposes such as low-cost housing, solar panelling, health, education, etc.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

It uses a qualitative approach through observation, documentation and interviews with officials and those in charge of waqf from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. The data was then elaborated with expert opinions based on Herman Daly’s sustainable economic theory and John Locke’s theory of ownership and Islamic law theory (hifz al-mãl, himãyah al-bī‘ah and istiṣlãh). This study found that through the waqf system, the waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia managed to reach certain achievements, namely good education, poverty reduction, hunger alleviation, and decent work. It was found that waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out various programs in every area of sustainable development, including providing drinking water. Another service included digging wells in areas where they were needed, which we rarely found in Indonesia. The Sustainable Waqf Law contributed to several aspects that could positively impact society and sustainable development in general. The Sustainable Waqf Law could positively impact sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. In addition, the waqf contributed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13 and 16.

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel Shariah-compliant portfolio optimization model tested on the daily historical return of 154 Shariah-compliant securities reported by the Shariah Advisory Council of Securities Commission Malaysia from 2011 to 2020. The mathematical model employs an annual rebalancing strategy subject to a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint while considering practical and Islamic trading concerns, including transaction costs, holding limits, and zakat payment. To validate the model, the optimal portfolios are compared against an Islamic benchmark index, a market index, and portfolios generated by the mean-variance model, as well as a forecast accuracy test by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error. Furthermore, this study examines the inter-stock relationship within the generated portfolios using correlation and Granger causality tests to identify the diversification performance. Results show an outperformance of the model in offering portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns under a comparably short computational time and an indication of generally well-diversified portfolios by the weak correlations between securities. The study further noted that the model is adept at risk management in addition to higher forecast accuracy during financial crises by showing remarkably fewer causal relationships during bear markets in 2011, 2014, and 2020. The findings of an inversed relationship between portfolio risk and the number of causalities between securities offer new insights into the effect of dynamic relationships between securities on portfolio diversification. In conclusion, the proposed model carries higher moral and social values than the conventional models while portraying high potential in enhancing the efficiency of asset allocation, contributing to economic diversification and the scarce literature on Islamic portfolio optimization modelling. The study also supports the substantially increasing demand for Shariah-compliant strategies following globalization and the changing demographic of the real financial world with growing priorities of social and sustainability values. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

Thus, authors adopt the methodology of QARDL to investigate the data of China in quantile form to acquire accurate and reliable outcomes. After (QARDL) quantile autoregressive distributed lag, the Wald test, and Granger causality test are run to understand the variables' relationships better. Hence, the outcomes indicate that green technology (GTI) has a negative and significant impact on CO2 emission in the long run across all the quantiles. Still, a contrary effect is seen in the short-run analysis. Whereas natural resources (NRR), economic integration (EIN), and social integration (SIN) have a positive impact in the long run. Still, significant levels differ, i.e. (NRR has no significant impact, EIN has a significant influence on carbon emission in the lower and middle quartile, and SIN has a significant impact at each quantile). Similarly, NNR has no significant associations with CO2 emission is seen across all the quantiles in the short run. However, economic integration and social integration positively and significantly impact lower quantiles. Based on these findings study provides some potential policy implications to overcome the fundamental issue of carbon emission in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we aim to examine the relationships between CO2 emissions and various factors including economic growth, urbanization, financial development, and energy consumption within Pakistan’s building sector. The study utilizes annual data spanning from 1990 to 2020. To analyze the cointegration relationship between these variables, we employ the quantile autoregressive distributed lag error correction model (QARDL-ECM). The findings of this research provide evidence supporting the presence of an asymmetric and nonlinear long-term relationship between the variables under investigation. Based on these results, we suggest the implementation of tariffs on nonrenewable energy sources and the formulation of policies that promote sustainable energy practices. By doing so, policymakers and architects can effectively contribute to minimising environmental damage. Overall, this study offers valuable insights that can assist policymakers and architects in making informed decisions to mitigate environmental harm while fostering sustainable development. © 2023 by author(s).},

The study is enhanced by estimation using Granger causality and autoregressive distributed lag. The results show that while green stock and sukuk have a negative impact on climate change over the long term, lag-1 and lag-2 are significantly impacted negatively in the short term by green sukuk. In the short run, green stocks are beneficial. While the industrial production index has a negative short-term impact on climate change, it has a favorable long-term impact. This suggests that there has to be an increase in both the short- and long-term tenors of Indonesia's global green sukuk.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Thus, Quantile Autoregressive Distributive Lag (QARDL) model and Granger Causality-in-Quantiles are applied to address non-linearity and structural breaks. The long-run results exhibit that eco-innovation and human capital have a significant negative relationship with carbon emissions, mainly from lower (0.05) to medium (0.5) quantiles and medium (0.50) to higher (0.95) emissions quantile. Moreover, economic growth contributes to higher emissions across all quantiles. In contrast, the square of economic growth has a significant negative association with emissions, confirming the validity of EKC from medium (0.40) to higher (0.95) quantiles. Lastly, Granger causality confirms a two-way causality between eco-innovation, human capital, and carbon emissions, and a one-way causality from human capital, economic growth to carbon emissions.

	abstract = {Nigeria’s economy is currently the largest in Africa and the world’s 26th, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$600 billion (roughly N81 trillion) in 2017. Unfortunately, the prevalence of poverty in Nigeria is also growing. According to the World Bank estimate, poverty accounts for more than 70% of the population, implying that over 130 million people live below the poverty line. Microfinance is one of the most successful strategies for eliminating poverty since it provides access to financial resources that can assist in reducing poverty by fostering financial involvement and empowerment. Despite the fact that there are over 800 microfinance banks in Nigeria, their contribution to the country’s economy is less than one percent. In addition, the basic objective of eradicating poverty has not yet been attained. Therefore, the extant literature has projected Islamic microfinance banks as a feasible solution to alleviate poverty in Nigeria, especially by looking at many Muslims in the country. Hence, Islamic microfinance banks continue witnessing minimal or no development in Nigeria. This study examines the obstacles impeding the growth of Islamic microfinance banks and their commercial viability. It also aims to provide solutions and recommendations to assist Islamic microfinance banks in regaining the public’s trust by expanding their financial inclusion through various Islamic micro-credit products as a viable alternative to the existing conventional microfinance banks that offer high-interest loans. This study uses qualitative research techniques to fulfil its objectives. The data for this study were gathered using a semi-structured interview. The research reveals several regulatory concerns, such as licence processes and substantial paid-up capital, which is one of the most significant obstacles. Similarly, awareness, misconception, and compliance continue to be the most critical obstacles for IMFBs in Nigeria. Implications of the study for microfinance institutions, policy regulators, and recommendations have been provided in line with the main findings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The sharing economy is a relatively recent phenomenon that aims to promote environmentally friendly practices. The sharing economy is characterized by the convergence of information, marketing and technology to create a new paradigm in which customers value access above ownership, allowing them to make better use of resources. It provides a modern business strategy that can pave the way for energy efficiency and sustainable economic development. However, the economic and environmental effects of the sharing economy are debatable and require more research. Indeed, the sharing economy has upended the current economic standard, raising concerns about the benefits and disadvantages of the new behaviour. Therefore, the present study fills a gap in the literature by quantitatively assessing the possible impacts of the sharing economy on sustainable economic development and energy efficiency in China over the period 2000 to 2019. Recently introduced QARDL estimation methodology is applied to achieve the objective, controlling for population growth, unemployment, energy prices, and inflation. The sharing economy is shown to make a positive contribution to promoting sustainable development across all quantile ranges, while it contributes to enhanced energy efficiency at higher quantiles only. According to the findings, the sharing economy turns out to be a socioeconomic phenomenon with the potential to promote energy efficiency and sustainable development. Therefore, we emphasize the potential of the sharing economy and recommend the Chinese promote sharing economy models to reach their full potential for sustainable development in energy efficiency and economic terms by enacting suitable taxation and legislation policies. © 2023 The Authors},

The existence of modern slavery which has re-emerged is an important concern to study because slavery is anti-development. Moreover, Islam seeks to abolish slavery, so that modern slavery should no longer occur in Islamic countries, including Indonesia. This research is conducted using a quantitative descriptive method, with Partial Least Square Method and data from Indonesia in particular since Indonesia is a country with the largest Muslim population in the world. This research is important to be carried out since this subject has never been studied quantitatively. The findings of this study, which are based on the discussion of existing data indicate that quantitatively, in the short term there is no impact on the distribution of Islamic social finance funds, in the form of zakat, infaq, sadaqah on modern slavery of children in Indonesia. Thus, Indonesia, considering that the existence of modern slavery is anti-development as marked by its effect on welfare, as an Islamic country with the largest population in the world should pay more attention to the eradication of modern slavery of children. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose and verify the suitability and applicability of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the State of Libya. The proposed models combine the unique features of social solidarity, cooperation “Ta’awan,” meeting religious requirements and providing financing more fairly and equitably. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is applied in this study through semi-structured interviews with several Libyan experts, including Islamic bankers, Shariah scholars, MSMEs experts, Islamic microfinance experts and academicians. The data collected from 2019 to 2021 and thematic analysis by computer-based software NVivo is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicate that the proposed Islamic equity-based microfinance models are suitable and applicable in Libya. This study also reveals that the proposed models have numerous potential benefits not only in meeting the financial needs of MSMEs but also in meeting the government objectives in economic divarication and socioeconomic development. Research limitations/implications: First, the study proposes the applicability and suitability of Islamic equity-based models in financing MSMEs only, while large firms are excluded from the study. Second, the study only proposes and tests the applicability of Islamic equity-modes of financing contracts, namely, Musharakah and Mudarabah, while Islamic debt-based financing models are not included. Finally, as there is no practical evidence of using those models for financing MSMEs in Libya, this study lacks empirical evaluations of equity models’ real benefits on income, employment generation, living standards improvement and business growth and sustainability. Practical implications: Given the importance of the MSMEs sector for the State of Libya’s economic growth, it is expected that the findings of this study can be of assistance in formulating guidelines and implementing Islamic equity-based microfinance programs. Besides, it can be a valuable source of information for policymakers for improving the functions of the current microfinance programs in the country. Additionally, as studies concerning Islamic alternative models for financing MSMEs are scarce, the current study can also be a reference point for researchers, academicians, practitioners and other stakeholders. Social implications: Providing capital support for the underfunded economy segment, attracting small savings, increasing investments and developing entrepreneurial skills could lead to improved economic productivity and growth. Originality/value: The present study proposes the structure of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for MSMEs in Libya and verifies the suitability of those proposed models among Libyan experts. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has been conducted on uncovering and exploring the potentials of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing MSMEs in Libya. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Current research investigates the role of green investment, information, and communication technology development growth in the Chinese economy’s carbon emissions from 1985-2015. This study has applied the quantile autoregressive distributed lagged (QARDL) approach and the Granger-causality in the quantiles to examine the causal linkage between the variables of interest. The findings through QARDL estimation confirm that there is an existence of significant reversion to the long-run equilibrium association between the explanatory variables and CO2. More specifically, the outcomes under long-run estimation confirm that GIN and ICT development plays a significant role in combating the issues like higher CO2 in China. At the same time, more economic growth leads to the destruction of the natural environment with higher carbon emissions. However, the square of economic growth shows some fruitful results towards fighting environmental pollution but not in all the quantiles of the study. Besides, the Granger-causality outcomes confirm the presence of a bi-directional association between green investment, ICT development, economic growth, and its square value. Based on the study findings, some policy implications are also provided. Besides, various limitations are also linked with this study. Firstly, the current study only examines the trends in CO2 emission from the context of China, whereas other regional economies are entirely neglected. Secondly, the factors like governmental influence in controlling carbon emission, environmental regulations, and governance mechanisms are entirely neglected in this research. Thirdly, the robust checking of the empirical findings is also missing in this study. Fourthly, economic uncertainty would also contribute to environmental pollution like CO2. Therefore, it is suggested that future studies should focus on these limitations to provide some meaningful suggestions and literature contributions. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to develop cash waqf models for Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT), a special Islamic microfinance institution in Indonesia, combining Islamic social finance in Baitul Maal (house of wealth) division and Islamic commercial finance in Baitut Tamwil (house of asset development) division, as integrated Islamic social and commercial microfinance in Indonesia, to achieve triple bottom-line, including outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Delphi and analytic network process methods, with three groups of relevant respondents, including experts (academic), BMT practitioners and regulators. Findings: The results show that the best cash waqf model for BMT is “BMT as Nazir (waqf manager) and also as cash waqf receiver Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Penerima Wakaf Uang (LKSPWU)”, followed by “BMT Association as representative Nazir of several certified BMTs”. Moreover, “long-term investment deposit” is the best to account cash waqf in the BMT balance sheet. With regard to financing, the most preferred one is “financing to regular Micro and Small Enterprises” of BMT members. Research limitations/implications: Having allowed BMT to be Nazir (waqf manager), this research might only benefit Indonesian policymakers, such as the Financial Services Authority and the Ministry of Cooperatives, BMTs and the National Waqf Board. But it may also benefit other countries which have similar characteristics. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt several alternatives of best models in managing cash waqf most appropriate for their specific conditions. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help the social activities of the Baitul Maal through social cash waqf and, indirectly, by productive cash waqf. Originality/value: Studies have been limited, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study discussing the integrated cash waqf model, cash waqf account and cash waqf investment appropriate for BMT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This program is initiated to respond the grave condition of water scarcity as the OIC countries only share 13.3% of the world renewable water due to the desertification, water mismanagement and inadequate water infrastructures. As practical guidelines, the OIC Water Vision employs Islamic values as follow: (1) Shura (consultation and participation); (2) Ijtihad (the seeking and sharing of knowledge); (3) avoiding Fassad (to not causing harm and equitable use), (4) Zakat (sharing of wealth with the poor), and (5) Waqf (the use of donated endowment funds). By using international collaboration as a theoretical framework, this article aims to depict the OIC’s vision of water sustainability; while qualitative method provides a valuable approach to examine both empirical and interpretative data related to the OIC Water Vision programs. We find that Islamic teachings play two aspects in this program, namely in the principal foundation and shared values. © 2022, Statistical Economic and Social Research and. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Technology innovation affects both the public and private non-financial sectors, the zakat institution (Islamic social finance) included. The institution uses an online system to communicate with zakat payers and zakat recipients to ensure its effectiveness in terms of collection and distribution. This research focuses on the adoption of a technique known as AD/AC and ZP/ZR, which is mainly utilized by partially and non-privatized State zakat institutions in Malaysia. To this end, three (3) techniques pertaining to appraising the performance of Malaysia’s Zakat institutions in managing Zakat funds were established. The analysis also includes the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of zakat collection of the respective zakat institutions in Malaysia. In this relation, a quantitative approach was adopted using the primary and secondary data collected from JAWHAR and various states’ zakat institutions. By utilizing a technique of online data collection and applying the AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR methods, the performance of Malaysia’s zakat institutions is appraised. Furthermore, with the help two (2) ratios and eight (8) scenarios the performance of the innovative technique of AD/AC and ZP/ZR for zakat collection and disbursement, efficiency and sustainability of zakat institutions in Malaysia were evaluated. The results show that most zakat institutions, particularly those that deal with zakat payments, have begun to use the technique AD/AC and ZP/ZR within their organizations. The performance of zakat institutions in all states in terms of zakat distribution and disbursement do not have a consistent trend for the period 2016-2020. However, there is still a dearth of technology being used for zakat disbursements and fund reporting. From the observed data, with 2016 being the exception, for each remaining year, a state in Malaysia is ranked as the best technology performer or the most efficient. Selangor - fully privatized state (2017), Pulau Pinang - fully privatized state (2018), Federal Territory - partially privatized state (2019) and Negeri Sembilan-partially privatized state (2020) are the most efficient for the respective year. The sustainability of each zakat institution in Malaysia in the presence of Covid-19 pandemic was ascertained as well. Interestingly, contrary to the efficiency result, all non-privatized states (Kedah, Sabah and Kelantan) and one partially privatized state (Negeri Sembilan) were sustainable in coping with Covid-19 pandemic, while all fully privatized states (Selangor and Pulau Pinang) were not. Overall, it was conjectured that the technique AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR would help to improve the operations of zakat institutions to become more efficient and successful in distributing zakat fund to the poor. However, as zakat collecting and distribution involved millions of records, its management is still debatable by all parties. © Authors.},

Hence, this study estimates the impact of ICT and urbanization on environmental sustainability in China using the novel quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) method. The results of the QARDL model state the negative and significant impact of ICT on CO2 emissions in China for all quantiles, implying that an increase in ICT proved to be an important factor in improving environmental quality. In contrast, the estimated coefficients of urbanization are positively significant for all quantiles. This finding sustains the idea that large-scale urbanization is detrimental to the environment because the process of urbanization is among the leading sources of carbon emissions. In the short run, the negative impact of ICT on CO2 emissions can only be seen in higher quantiles, while the positive impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions is confirmed for all quantiles. Lastly, the asymmetric impact of ICT and urbanization is confirmed in the short and long run with the help of Wald tests. The ICT diffusion and smart urbanization approach can help in attaining environmental sustainability targets. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Improving environmental quality has become one of the utmost essential policy agendas of the United States (US). The susceptibility to climate change adversities has motivated the need to construct and identify the factors that can function to evaluate and ensure environmental sustainability. Although few studies have highlighted the importance of recycling and technology in tackling environmental woes across different industries and sectors, little is known about the impact of national-level recycling and green technology innovation on consumption-based (trade-adjusted) carbon emissions. Therefore, this study scrutinizes the asymmetric linkages between recycling, climate technologies, trade, and consumption-based carbon emissions (CCE) in the US from 1990Q1 to 2018Q4. It employs novel Quantile Autoregressive Distributive Lag (QARDL) and Granger Causality-in-Quantiles to discover the asymmetric long-run cointegration and causality across the diverse data distribution. The long-run results indicate that recycling and climate-related technologies significantly mitigate CCE in the long run, mainly at lower-higher (0.05–070) and lower-highest (0.05–0.95) emissions quantiles, respectively. Trade-based covariates suggest that imports significantly contribute to CCE from upper-middle to highest (0.70–0.95) emissions quantiles, while exports significantly reduce CCE from lowest to highest (0.05–0.95) emissions quantiles. The short-run elasticities echo a similar direction; however, their magnitude and significance vary across quantiles. Moreover, Granger-causality outcomes in quantiles confirm one-way causality between recycling, climate technologies, and CCE, and two-way causality between exports, imports, economic growth, and CCE across major quantiles. These results provide pertinent policy suggestions for all stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Waqf has historically been a vital institution in Islam in fulfilling religious needs and improving social welfare. Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Public trust and contributions are also low due to the opacity of the accounting and accountability system. Scholars have proposed adopting the blockchain technology to mitigate these issues. The implementation of the blockchain technology is to provide a solution for waqf organisations towards offering transparency to their donors and building trust to gain more support towards the waqf organisation’s mission and work. The blockchain technology manages information within the waqf system by enhancing the aspects of transparency and reliability in how funds are collected, managed, and distributed. This study has two objectives: first, to look into the technological role of blockchain in managing waqf assets in ensuring the most efficient way of financing waqf projects. Second, this research is aimed at exploring and understanding the blockchain technology regarding the issues of trust and accountability in waqf organisations in Malaysia. The study methods consisted of content analysis and an interview. The content analysis focused on publicly accessible information online such as home pages, websites, user interface pages, and annual and financial reports. The semi-structured interview was carried out with a representative of a waqf organisation who has extensive knowledge of these technologies. This article is an effort to contribute to the body of knowledge by exploring blockchain technology’s potential applications and their limits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The purpose of this article is to analyze the legal policy of zakat management with the model of the voluntary system and its implications for the realization of social and economic justice in the community. This research is normative legal research with primary legal sources in the form of laws and regulations related to zakat management legal policies, which are then analyzed descriptively and qualitatively. According to the findings of the study, the legal policy of zakat management with a voluntary system model is based on the principle of community volunteerism in zakat payment. This voluntary system model is heavily reliant on public legal awareness regarding zakat payment. The use of the voluntary system model has consequences for the community's non-optimal fulfillment of social and economic justice, which is caused by a lack of state involvement through legal policies. The state's role is required to enforce the zakat law by compelling zakat obligors to fulfill their obligations. On the other hand, the potential for zakat remains enormous, and it must be managed optimally. © 2023 Zainuddin, Aan Aswari and Salle.},

	abstract = {Ethical investments, such as socially responsible investment (SRI), and faith-based investments, such as Islamic finance, have become commonplace in the economic development discourse. Given that SRI bonds dominate SRI markets, one might ask why SRI Sukūk (Islamic bonds) have not contributed more to certain social or sustainability-related causes or sectors to achieve the objectives of Sharīʿah (Islamic law). This study will mainly examine the aspects considered ethically or socially responsible as incorporated in SRI and Islamic finance. In doing so, this study will compare the values or principles of SRI bonds and the SRI Sukūk framework to enable Islamic finance players to make good use of the opportunity of the segment. This study further examines what limits the involvement of Islamic financial market participants in socially responsible investment. Drawing on the 2014 SRI Sukūk framework and other SRI legislation, this study reveals that both have similar qualities, characteristics and objectives. However, SRI sukuk are challenged by investors’ appetite for a profitable return, lack of awareness of social investment and lack of data and methodology associated with the Triple Bottom Line or 3Ps (people, planet and profit) approach. These problems have, to some extent, limited the Islamic financial market players from investing in social responsibility programes © 2022,Journal of King Abdulaziz University, Islamic Economics.

According to the findings of QARDL, the long-run estimated coefficients of renewable energy consumption and higher education are positively significant in most quantiles. However, in the long run, the estimates attached to ICT are insignificant in the CO2 emissions model in most quantiles. On the other hand, the estimates of renewable energy consumption are significantly positive from the 50th quantile and onward in the green growth model, confirming that the higher the renewable energy in the economy, closer it will get to the target of green economic growth. The long-run estimates of higher education and ICT are positively significant at most quantiles in the green growth model. In the short run, renewable energy consumption turned out to be the most critical determinant of CO2 emissions and green growth. Copyright © 2022 Deshuai, Hui and Ullah.},

	abstract = {The economic complexity index is an effective dimensionality reduction tool that is applied to forecast and predict future economic growth, income, and environmental quality. Renewable energy plays an important role in mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. This study explores the nexus between economic complexity, renewable energy, FDI, trade, and environmental quality in Japan for the period 1970Q1-2019Q4. We use carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as dependent variable while economic complexity index (ECI), foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow, renewable energy (RNE), and trade as explanatory variables. This study applies a quantile autoaggressive approach for analysis; the result of this study suggests a long-run implication of the ECI, FDI, GDP, RNE, and trade for the CO2 emissions. While only RNE and trade show mixed results in the short run, the rest of the variables do not have short-run implications. This implies that emissions mostly result in the industrial production activities only in the long run and in some quantiles only in the short run. The Japanese government may adopt different measures to reduce the CO2 emissions in the country, such as carbon tax and tax exemption on renewable energy investment. Furthermore, the government may adopt the renewal energy in production, which could achieve sustainable development goal.  © 2023 Muhammad Haroon Shah et al.},

	abstract = {No one denied the significant role of transportation infrastructure in economic development; however, it is also considered a major contributor to global warming. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development, it is imperative to transform the transport sector investment into low-carbon transportation choices. The public-private partnership investment in the transport sector could be proved a suitable tool for sustainable transport and efficiency. Therefore, we investigate the significance of public-private partnership investment (PPP) on transport emissions by incorporating the role of environmental innovation, economic growth, and population. Our preliminary findings confirm that all variables are abnormally distributed and embodied with structural breaks that distort true parameters in traditional regression. In compliance, we employ Quantile ARDL (QARDL) technique which provides more reliable results in case of non-normality, dynamic trends, and structural changes in data. The long-run empirical outcomes indicate that PPP reduces transport emissions mainly from middle (40th) to highest (95th) emissions quantiles. Similarly, environmental innovation reduces transport emissions from 60th to 95th quantiles. These results imply that the emissions-mitigating effect of PPP and environmental innovation is only pronounced at higher levels of transport emissions. The results provide valuable policy recommendations. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Insights gained from institutional work and institutional logic were used to theorise the findings. Findings: The IMFI used mainly financial measures to manage its performance, which were interlinked with the commercialisation approach in the industry, and the top management’s focus on the financial sustainability of the organisation. The lack of social goals and the use of reward-based financial measures did not weaken the solidified social values at the operational level, due to the independence of the operational units, the compartmentalisation of profit-making activities and the institutional work of the operational managers. The operational managers acted as carriers of this social logic. Religious values formed the pillar of the permanence of social values in the IMFI. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the internal practices of IMFIs, and the role of religious values in the permanence of social logic in the context of an NGO-based IMFI. The lack of measurable social goals, as well as their rewards, does not compromise the focus on poverty alleviation and community development in view of the intrinsic rewards and accountability of the operational managers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to highlight the importance of waqf in financing higher educational institutions (HEIs) and its potential as an alternative source of generating additional funds for the HEIs, and discourses on waqf practice, fundraising, waqf management and utilisation of waqf income for the development of higher education in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the information gathered through interviews with 12 participants who are actively engaged in waqf in different capacities. The participants can easily be classified into three expert groups; personnel of waqf-based universities, personnel of the respective State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs) and waqf practitioners. In addition, archival records, relevant documents and library sources have been used in the research. Findings: The study learnt that waqf in Malaysia is centralised and exclusively controlled by the SIRCs, which are, as a rule, sole trustees of all categories of awqaf in the respective states; hence, any form of private trusteeship is considered illegal. It is a prerequisite for the establishment of a waqf fund to obtain permission from the respective SIRCs, and bring it under the purview of the council prior to setting up a waqf. The ministry of higher education has taken some initiatives to encourage HEIs to use waqf as an alternative source of generating funds. Subsequently, numerous public universities have set up waqf funds and developed a comprehensive mechanism for raising the fund through traditional and modern methods and technologies. A major chunk of the waqf funds is collected in the form of cash, but the amount falls short of reaching critical mass to enable the waqf to become self-sustaining. The study found that the universities also involved themselves in various social welfare programmes, especially in health care, and some income-generating projects besides seeking support from the waqf fund for their academic and educational activities. Practical implications: The paper brings out the fact that waqf offers the best features as an alternative fiscal instrument to finance projects of public good, including higher education at three selected waqf-based universities in Malaysia. Social implications: The study’s findings will be helpful to the ummah in general and Malaysia in particular. It can help policymakers, legislators and academicians in formulating new strategies for the common good and sensitize the countries facing a huge fiscal deficit and lack of development to the viability and potential of waqf as a catalyst for progress and economic activity. Originality/value: The paper shares the experience of Malaysia’s waqf-based universities, waqf fundraising, management and income utilisation. It accentuates the fact that waqf can help finance academic activities at universities and sheds light on some useful examples of waqf-based universities founded in earlier periods of Islamic civilisation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims at explaining variances in the contribution of Islamic crowdfunding platforms (ICFPs) to sustainable development (SD), by adopting an institutional logic perspective (ILP). ICFPs represent a dual institutional overlap between two logics (the Western-mainstream and the Islamic logic) which have an impact on corporate social responsibility (CSR) interpretations, practices, and decisions and whose conflicts are mitigated by choosing different resolution strategies. The authors aim at showing that this choice affects SD differently. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a conceptual typology through the following steps: (1) choice of variables and identification of corresponding variable domains, through literature review. Variables chosen are the elemental CSR dimensions related to various social and environmental corporate responsibilities to whom diverse meaning and emphasis are given under the Western-mainstream and Islamic logics. (2) Identification of three distinct ideal types of ICFPs, building on different resolution strategies to mitigate conflicts between logics; (3) development, for each ideal type, of a set of implications related to SD; (4) implementation of a first test aiming at assigning real cases to each ideal type. Findings: The authors identify Western-mimicking (platforms adopting as resolution strategy decoupling or compartmentalizing strategies), Islamic-driven (platforms focusing on one prevailing logic) and Syncretism-inspired (platforms adopting hybridizing practices) ideal-types. Originality/value: It is the first paper suggesting ILP to explain variances in crowdfunding platforms' role in addressing SD.

	abstract = {This study revisits the influence of renewable energy intake, globalization, trade, and GDP on carbon pollution in the United States of America (USA). Although previous studies have mostly used parametric techniques, we investigate the cointegrating association between carbon dioxide emission (CO2e) and its known drivers using the non-parametric quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) methodology considering data from 1970 to 2019. This technique allows us to check whether the impacts are homogeneous or heterogeneous across different emission quantiles and helps in proposing dynamic policies accordingly. The findings reveal that across all the quantiles the long-run parameter of renewable energy consumption shows an inverse relationship with the CO2e. On the other side, the nexus between globalization and CO2e is positive across all quantiles. It is interesting to note that trade does not affect CO2e in any quantile while GDP has a favorable influence only in the lower quantiles. Additionally, we used a quantile Granger causality technique and discovered a pertinent bidirectional link that corroborates the QARDL model's findings. This study also promoted a dynamic policy paradigm that is centred on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve SDG-13 by mitigating climate change effects and attain SDG-7 by promoting clean energy consumption in the USA. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

In this area, there has been much discussion of the significance of natural resources in the research; moreover, there has yet to be much research on how these resources affect the monetary inclusion of emerging nations. This research utilized China's management of funds, technological development, and unpredictability of economic strategy to examine the viability of the resources curse theory concerning financial growth. Quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL), a cutting-edge methodology, was used to evaluate the asymmetry relationship between variables from 1970 to 2015. The resources constraint theory, which contends that the rents from environmental assets constrain economic advancement, is backed up by research data for China. Volatility in economic strategy also harms financial growth. Contrarily, financial diversification and technical advancement sped up economic development and offset the drawbacks of environmental assets. According to the results, appropriate natural resource utilization, funding redistribution at local administration levels, and a shift towards green initiatives should all be put in place as semiconducting short- and long-term marketing strategies and regulatory requirements to turn the blight into a full endorsement. © 2023},

The work that explored this subject largely concentrated on the ideals of charitable practices, such as the faith-based tenets of social welfare as an Islamic communal practice and the religiously mandated form of almsgiving (zakat). But during the late 1990s, a new generation of scholars challenged the assumption of charity across the region as only a pious act and sought to address the dearth of literature on the subject. They shifted critical focus onto the history of philanthropy to consider and account for the social, economic, and political structures that shaped a wide range of charitable practices, activities, institutions, benefactors, and recipients. They also interrogated how communities determined the parameters of need, developed notions of the “deserving poor,” and mediated the relationship between the ideals and practices of beneficence. Overlapping fields such as social history and women's studies as well as analytics of gender, class, and national identity informed and advanced historical studies of charity and philanthropy across the Middle East. The subfield continues to innovate with new work across academic disciplines and new publishing venues for further studies of charity in the region across time periods. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research paper aims to determine the factors needed to propose a platform where waqf (Islamic endowment) organizations can collaborate with government public hospitals to develop corporate waqf hospitals. Consequently, the elements of governance and sustainability are included in the management of corporate waqf hospitals thereby leading to the corporatization of public hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the qualitative research methodology and undertakes content analysis of data collected from journal articles, magazines and official websites. Data analysis involves open coding with NVivo 12. Findings: General findings from the literature review have shown that architectural and engineering fundamentals were essential factors in the success of past waqf hospitals of the era between 8th and 14th centuries. In that era, the decentralized waqf-based hospitals employed the mutawalli (the trustee/manager of the waqf assets) to govern the administration of the hospitals. Present corporate waqf hospitals can exploit the elements identified from past waqf-based hospitals and additionally adopt the private-public partnership model in the form of a muḍārabah (profit-sharing contract) agreement to design a sustainable waqf governance model for Malaysian public healthcare services. Research limitations/implications: The proposed platform is designed for a corporate waqf model developed in collaboration between Malaysian waqf institutions and public healthcare services. It abides by both the Malaysian fatwa (Islamic rulings) on waqf and the laws of the Malaysian Government. Practical implications: There is potential for developing the Malaysian corporate waqf-governance healthcare model which will enable the hospital to provide better quality healthcare to more patients through upgrading the quality of equipment used in hospitals and/or better facilities at equal or lower costs. Consequently, this will not only improve waqf management and distribution but also result in reduction of government expenditure. Social implications: This research promotes the concept of a corporate waqf hospital which will provide innumerable beneficial healthcare services in terms of improved healthcare quality at affordable costs to the general public and at no cost to the poor and the underprivileged. Originality/value: Although waqf has played an important role as a vehicle for Islamic financing in the society for centuries, a model of collaboration or partnership of waqf with public healthcare services has yet to be explored and developed. With proper corporate governance and well-managed sustainability in a corporate waqf model, this newly developed partnership between waqf institutions and public healthcare providers can be a first step in many more interesting collaborative arrangements that can be established between waqf institutions and public services in the future. © 2021, Raja Aishah binti Raja Adnan, Mahazan Abdul Mutalib and Muhammad Ridhwan Ab Aziz.},

The findings of this study reveal that among the other two, social pillars are the main criteria for the SDGs. In addition, the maqashid al-sharia framework's main objective is preserving religion (deen) as a means of enforcing religious responsibilities. Therefore, stakeholders need to consider this element.

The Internet of Things (IoT) and environmental regulations have the potential to support green growth. Therefore, this study intends to examine the empirical link between the IoT, environmental regulations, and green growth in China by utilizing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) methods to analyze data from 1997 to 2021. Data are obtained from reputable local and international sources like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Development Indicators (WDI), the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Findings derived from the baseline ARDL model prove that the IoT, environmental regulations, renewable energy consumption, and research and development (R&D) encourage long-run green growth. Likewise, the robust model also highlights that the internet, environmental policy stringency, renewable energy consumption, and R&D help encourage green growth. In the short run, environmental policy stringency and the internet are favorably linked to green growth in the robust model, and renewable energy consumption is favorably linked to green growth in the baselines model; however, environmental regulation is negatively linked to green growth. The findings from the QARDL analysis show that the impact of the IoT on promoting green growth is significant across all quantiles. On the other hand, the effects of environmental regulation are more pronounced at higher levels of green growth. These findings imply that policymakers should try to increase the role of digitalization in society by promoting the IoT and the internet to decouple economic growth and environmental pollution. Moreover, the digitalization policy should be supported by implementing strict environmental laws and regulations. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Zakat in Islam has historically been a vital institution in fulfilling religious needs and social welfare. Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness distribution process and lack of transparency in the zakat management are commonly cited as key impediments (bin Khatiman et al., 2021). Blockchain is expected to solve these issues due to its ability to record and trace every transaction, allowing administrators to discharge their accountability to zakat stakeholders. Thus, this study intended to develop a zakat collection blockchain system with the aim to provide economical and integrated continuous real-time zakat transactions, transparency and traceability by developing smart contracts in zakat management. The study employed four stages of process based on waterfall model starting from the interview session and analyse of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on zakat collection in the Zakat Collection Centre or Pusat Pungutan Zakat-Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). Then, design requirement specification (DRS) is employed after being reviewed and approved by PPZ-MAIWP. The results show that the development of blockchain in the zakat collection system could be eradicating extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity among the community in the country. The study contributes through a transparent and reliable environment for exchanging data and carrying out transactions through a decentralized digital ledger technology to record anything of value and as a result able to ensure transparency, reliability, trust ability and traceability of the zakat transactions. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Sustainable economic development is the primary goal of each economy. In this regard, the role of natural resources has been extensively debated in the existing literature; however, the studies on the natural resource's influence on the financial development of developing countries are scarce. This study investigates the validity of the resource curse hypothesis related to financial development by recruiting fiscal decentralization, technology innovation, and economic policy uncertainty in China. The study employed the contemporary and innovative approach of quantile autoregressive distribution lag (QARDL) to evaluate the asymmetric association between variables from 1990 to 2020. Empirical findings validate the resource curse hypothesis in China, which implies that the natural resource rent compressed financial development. Likewise, economic policy uncertainty also adversely affected financial development. In contrast, fiscal decentralization and technological innovation accelerated financial development and neutralized the negative consequences of natural resources. Based on the findings, conductive short-run and long-run business strategies and regulations should be implemented, including the adequate consumption of natural resources, reallocation of funds at regional government levels, and transformation toward sustainable technologies to shift the curse into a blessing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Moreover, we control the effect of economic growth and industrialization in dealing with the association between the variables of interest from Q1-2000 to Q4-2020. The association between the variables has been examined through Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model, which determines the change in the primary dependent variable (i.e., material footprints) over lower, medium, and higher order quantiles. The initial findings confirm the non-normal trends in the data with the stationarity properties. The results show that economic policy uncertainty is causing more damage in creating a higher resource footprint. Contrarily, energy transition, and digital trade tend to reduce resources burden. More specifically, the impact of policy uncertainty on material footprints is higher at higher-order quantiles and lower at lower-order quantiles. Similarly, energy transition significantly reduces the material footprints across all the quantiles. Considering the role of digital trade, it is found that except for the 0.10th quantile, trade facilities are suitable for reducing material footprints in China. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study examines zakat (obligatory charity) as a tax deduction in Aceh. Currently, the existing legal rule stipulates that zakat paid by muzakkī (zakat payers) to the National Zakat Board (BAZNAS) and Zakat Official Institution (LAZ) is deducted from taxable income. However, this rule has not been applied since there is no Government Regulation. This empirical legal study used a statutory approach, analyzing the point of view of legal politics theory. This study concludes that the State and Islamic Law in Aceh are closely related to the political context of Indonesian law. The government regulations from the Old Order to the Reform Era related to Islamic Law or Muslims have been greatly influenced by political configurations. When the configuration is democratic, the legal character embraces democratic values and vice versa. As a result, the legal regulations regarding zakat have not yet been enforced due to the strong political configuration. However, referring to the arguments and logic of legal politics that the government is democratic towards the aspirations in Aceh, the Governmental Regulation Draft/Rancangan Peraturan Pemerintah (RPP) for Zakat as Tax Deduction will strengthen the previous legal rule, stipulating zakat as a tax deduction factor. The unification of zakat and taxes in one legal instrument by the government, which has political and structural authority, will be able to realize justice and economic and social welfare of the community as the primary goal of zakat. © 2022, Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University (UIN) Jakarta.

	abstract = {The literature gap in microfinance paradox of double bottom line (financial performance vs. outreach) has always been an interesting area of research. This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIs’ to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower. © 2022, The Author(s).},

In addition, the recent spread of COVID-19 instigates the impact of environmental pollution, exaggerates the virus intensity, and lowers people’s immunity due to poor air quality. Therefore, this study explored the role of green energy efficiency and climate technologies in achieving carbon neutrality in China using an advanced quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) framework. The results indicated that green energy efficiency and climate technologies significantly reduce environmental pollution across all quantiles in the long run. In contrast, urbanization enhances environmental degradation at lower and higher emissions quantiles, while trade only promotes environmental pollution at lower quantiles. These findings suggested using alternative energy sources and carbon-reducing technologies to ensure a sustainable environment. Copyright © 2022 Liu, Qiu and Zhu.},

This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 405 scientific papers on zakat recorded in the Scopus database until 2021. Various tools have been used – Microsoft Excel for frequency analysis, VOSviewer for data visualization, and Harzing’s Publish or Perish for metrics and citation analysis. This study finds that the number of zakat literature has increased significantly and consistently over the last ten years. The fields of Social Science, Business, Management, Accounting, Economics, and Finance are areas where zakat literature often appears in and is based in countries in the US, Europe and Asia. English is used in most zakat literature, along with several other languages like Malay, Arabic, German, Indonesian, Slovak, and Turkish. Research results also indicate that the zakat literature is mainly found in the subject areas of economics, finance, management, and accounting. The use of keywords such as zakat, Malaysia, zakat institution, poverty alleviation, zakat distribution, zakat management, social welfare, education, efficiency, and human are widespread. This study also found that Malaysia, Indonesia, America, Saudi Arabia, and Britain have become the five countries that have played a major role in creating collaborative zakat research.

In this regard, this study aimed to investigate the role of green energy consumption, eco-innovation, and urbanization while explaining the dream of low-carbon economy and environmental sustainability in the context of Pakistan using annual time series dataset spanning from 1990 to 2020. The short-run and long-run associations among explained and explanatory variables were investigated using the symmetric, asymmetric, and quantile autoregressive distributed lag models. The findings of the study demonstrated that low-carbon economy, green energy consumption, ecological innovation, urbanization, GDP per capita, and labor force are cointegrated for the long-term association in symmetric, asymmetric, and quantile autoregressive distributed lag models. Furthermore, green energy consumption and effective eco-innovation are the most important paths to ensure environmental sustainability, while urbanization, GDP per capita, and labor force contribute negatively to the low-carbon economy. The findings of the study provide a policy framework for the development of a comprehensive strategy to promote environmental sustainability in Pakistan by emphasizing green energy consumption, ecological innovation, and controlled urbanization, as well as the incorporation of environment friendly policies into economic development policies. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

Islamic scholars and financiers are now debating the distinctive contribution of Islamic finance to global sustainability. While mainstream global finance has only recently begun to pay explicit attention to social and environmental sustainability, Islamic economics has always emphasised the need to benefit society, the community, and the environment. Objectives: We ask what has been the influence of the emergence of green and social finance upon Islamic finance in Malaysia, the global centre of Islamic finance. Methods: The study is based on collaborative, co-productive ethnography and autoethnography, and textual analysis of working documents of the Securities Commission Malaysia, focusing on how environmental requirements are expressed in new financial products, known as green sukuks, or green Islamic bonds. Results and conclusions: We have found that much of the moral debate in Islamic finance has revolved around the distribution of financial risk: when investors share the risk of failure, they can participate in society rather than merely exploiting social relations, yet the emergence of ‘green’ Islamic finance appears to shift the centre of moral gravity away from risk structuring towards technical criteria of sustainability, replicating the growth-oriented anthropocentric managerialism of mainstream finance. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study demonstrates the linkages between green technological innovations, sustainable tourism, financial development, economic growth, and ecological sustainability using China's regional data from 2000 to 2019. The study applies the novel estimation technique, Quantile Autoregressive Distributive Lag (QARDL) approach to examine long-run and short-run relationships between the stated variables. The initial findings confirm non-linearity in the data verified through J-B test statistics. It approves the implication of QARDL estimation for exploring ecological sustainability trends over the study period. The study outcomes confirm that tourism and green technology innovation assists in reducing ecological footprints in China in the long run. Moreover, financial development and economic growth reflect a direct role towards more ecological footprints; therefore, the sustainability dimension has been missing both in financial development and growth. Furthermore, the results in the short run cover the same phenomenon and confirm that ecological innovations and tourism would help in sustaining the natural environment. The study outcomes demonstrate that government officials in China should specifically implement long-term policies to support the natural environment from adverse shocks of more financial development and economic growth. © 2022 The Author(s).

Solar energy appears to be a strong indicator to improve quality of air by reducing CO2 emissions, which has neglected by the available literature. Therefore, the study considers exploring the dynamic role of solar energy in CO2 emissions and economic growth in a sample of US. We applied the QARDL approach and covered the period ranging from 1990 to 2019. Our findings showcased that solar energy mitigates CO2 emissions by increasing economic growth in different quantiles in the USA. Solar energy use is increasing economic growth at higher quantiles in the USA. Eco innovations are also contributing to economic growth by reducing CO2 emissions in different quantiles. Bidirectional quantile causality was found between the constructs. This study suggested the usage of solar energy and eco-innovations in the sustainable growth pattern of the country. © 2023, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The potential of waqf is so great in Indonesia but has not been optimized. This paper aims to offer a model for waqf institutions to adopt financial technology for developing productive and social waqf. The authors cunduct an assesment of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) in seeing to the crowdfunders’ behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a structural equation using the partial least square approach to test the hypotheses. Based on purposive sampling, the spread of questionnaires through online surveys throughout Indonesia consists of all islands. A total of 297 respondents collected the questionnaires. Findings: Based on the findings, acceptance models have a positive and significant impact on the behavioral intentions of crowdfunders, while Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology have no significant effect. Research limitations/implications: The sample of this study involved potential crowdfunders from all over the islands in Indonesia, but these results cannot be generalized because of limitations in terms of the sampling technique used. However, the results of this study can be used as an illustration of how crowdfunders behave in donating money using financial technology. Practical implications: The results of this study provide a comprehensive perspective for policymakers, especially the Indonesian Waqf Board as the waqf authority that regulates waqf nazir to improve quality by adopting crowdfunding financial technology in collecting waqf funds. In addition, in terms of implications for the government, this waqf crowdfunding model will reduce spending and increase economic growth. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in looking at the waqf crowdfunding in Indonesia by looking at two reliable technology determinant models. Studies on cash waqf in Indonesia are many, but they do not look at the issue of crowdfunding, which has gained more attention recently. This paper aims to fill this gap, and this becomes the novelty. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study aims to explore the implementation of Corporate Waqf Core Principles (CWCP), a set of sharia principles for corporate waqf implemented in the growth of waqf in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative research with a specific focus on comparative analysis of the advantages of waqf management at two different institutions that develop corporate waqf, Waqf Board Foundation of Universitas Islam Indonesia (YBW UII) Yogyakarta and Pesantren Tebuireng in Jombang. YBW UII Yogyakarta has developed productive waqf assets and immovable objects through professional and profitable multi-company institutions, ensuring that the waqf’s results expand and the benefits fly. Pesantren Tebuireng, on the other hand, understands the implementation of CWCP in the framework of productive waqf administration and management by conceptualizing the productivity of waqf assets through corporate and institutional management. The two models of waqf management methods ensure that waqf management within the corporate institutional framework is more productive and produces long-term outcomes and benefits. However, there are certain deviations in the implementation of the CWCP which has not used shares as waqf assets. The development of this waqf model in Indonesia can accelerate community economic development. © 2022 Miftahul Huda and Lukman Santoso.},

	abstract = {Sustainable economic growth is the prime concern of each country without compromising environmental sustainability. Therefore investors seek the opportunities such as investment in clean energy stocks having significant social, economic, and environmental benefits for the society. Existing studies have explored various macroeconomic factors that deeply influenced the performance of clean energy stock. However, none of the studies has examined the nexus of financial stress, commodity price volatility (Oil, natural gas, gold), and clean energy stock from a global perspective. The study fills the gap by exploring the dynamic relationship among the study variables and employs the advanced methodology of “The quantile autoregressive distributed lag "(QARDL) approach from January 1, 2008, to April 30, 2021. The empirical findings of the study suggest that increased financial stress index and oil & gold prices significantly depress the performance of clean energy stocks in the long-run and short-run, whereas the natural gas has a positive influence on the clean energy stock only in the long run while in the short-run it has no significant influence. The study significantly provides a clear picture of these macroeconomic variables' interdependencies in all market conditions based on the empirical outcomes. This will provide greater investment opportunities for investors and helps the policymakers to establish better policies and strategies to boost global clean energy stock performance. © 2022},

	abstract = {India is a major developing world economy that has predominantly been highly energy-intensive and fossil fuel dependent. Consequently, this South Asian nation has not been able to safeguard its environment from persistent degradation through the discharge of greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this study tries to reveal the relationships between Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions, renewable energy consumption, international trade, and economic growth in India in order to recommend policies that can help the nation attain carbon neutrality. Both the conventional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the newly developed Quantile ARDL (QARDL) models are used in this study. The ARDL results unveil that 1% increase in renewable energy consumption contributes to 0.8% reduction in CO2 emissions, while economic growth boosts CO2 emissions in the long run. Besides, international trade deteriorates the environment by amplifying emissions only in the short run. The QARDL results reveal that economic growth positively and renewable energy consumption negatively affect CO2 emissions across all quantiles of CO2 emissions. In contrast, international trade is not found to exert any statistically significant effect on CO2 emissions. Lastly, the quantile-based causality analysis somewhat supports the regression findings by verifying causal associations between the variables of concern in India’s context. Thus, in light of these findings, several carbon neutrality-related policy insights are put forward. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, questions remain over the efficacy and integrity of these financial instruments. Climate bonds impose additional accountability requirements that connect the money raised with actions to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases. These requirements are given further prominence in financial instruments intended to fund climate change while complying with core Islamic values, such as the green sukuk, a Sharia-compliant alternative to traditional fixed-income investments to fund environmental projects. Climate-related financial instruments require tracking the flow of money through chains of decisions within and between organisations. This research explores how the Indonesian government, as the first sovereign state issuer of green sukuk, attempted to connect money raised from Islamic capital markets to actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This required the creation of new accounting objects that connected financial data with GHG accounting at a granular level. Our analysis demonstrates how the existing accounting systems were repurposed by constructing green sukuk accounting objects that sought to connect equivalent disbursements of money with social and environmental benefits, primarily represented by reduced GHG emissions. © 2022 Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research.},

The results of the two models confirm, on the one hand, the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and, on the other hand, the role of renewable energy consumption in mitigating carbon emissions in advanced and developing economies. Furthermore, the finding shows that the supply chain disruption for the long run is positive at all quantiles, indicating the evidence of association at the extreme low and high quantiles than at the intermediate quantile. In addition, the effect of the supply chain decreases at the lower quantile. It turns negative at the upper 90th quantile in the short run, indicating that the supply chain disruption reduces the environmental degradation under the bearish market conditions. In the future, the increasing supply chain disruptions due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and further COVID-19 worldwide can consider sluggish economic growth and play an essential role in promoting renewable energy abundance and reducing CO2 emissions.

	abstract = {The number of urban settlements in Indonesia continues to grow, while the paucity of communal space in urban areas persists. Therefore, it is vital to support local potential to achieve long-term success. Waqf generosity is one form of social development that has been institutionalized in society. Waqf, or benevolent generosity in surrendering personal possessions for the public good, is carried out by almost the entire Muslim community worshiping Allah SWT. This research aims to uncover the role of waqf in the formation of public spaces from a long-term perspective. This study employs a case study method to comprehend the real life of the waqf spatial entity in the urban village. The research location is Tugurejo Village, Tugu District, Semarang City. The study deviates from the grand theory to investigate the events at the study site. Interview, observation, and secondary data are used to acquire data; descriptive methods are used to analyze the data, and the research findings are fed back into the grand theory. The research found that sustaining communal ownership rights and productivity advantages between generations ensures the sustainability of waqf as a communal space, resulting in a sustainable community structure. © 2022 Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang.

The questionnaire was distributed to women micro-entrepreneurs in Selangor state employing a convenience sampling method. The model was analysed utilising the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that Islamic microfinancing, human capital, and ICT usage positively influence the performance of women micro-entrepreneurs. The empirical findings enhance the literature by extending the resource-based view (RBV), a soft theory in the organisational theory literature, by incorporating Islamic microfinancing in the context.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess enterprise risk management (ERM) practices in waqf institutions (WIs) along with their strengths and weaknesses; highlight ERM trends in WIs; and determine the best ERM practices for these institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via structured interviews with nine WI managers in Malaysia. A standardised questionnaire was adopted for the interviews, which focussed on ERM implementation in WIs. The collected data were analysed in three steps, namely, data reduction, data display and verification/conclusion. The frequency distribution of these data were then illustrated and the mean values and differences of the studied groups/variables were examined. Findings: WIs have a sub-optimal ERM implementation, whose aspects need to be improved over time. These institutions have focussed on their ERM practices at the strategic level yet ignored those at the operational level. Specifically, WI officers have well-defined internal environments and objectives, but risk monitoring, which ensures effective implementation of ERM, is lacking. The presence of risk management committees and units may be linked with the successful implementation of ERM. However, ERM knowledge and top management support do not show clearly associations with ERM implementation. WIs should focus on improving their ERM implementation governance. Research limitations/implications: Findings underscore the need for WIs to launch a formal ERM programme and for relevant stakeholders to create the appropriate infrastructures that support ERM implementation, including amended rules, ERM policies and allocated funds for training and education, to promote ERM implementation knowledge and awareness. The successful implementation of ERM not only improves the service quality, sustainability and performance of WIs but also promotes the national waqf agenda as a key economic driver. Originality/value: ERM in non-profit organisations, such as WIs, has received limited research attention relative to that in profit-driven organisations despite having unique risks. To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first to identify those trends that explain ERM practices and to determine the ERM best practices of WIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It explained the types of feudalism and indicated what leads to ownership or not. Moreover, It includes a list of the legal controls of feudalism and presents it during the reign of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the guided caliphs. The study assumed that feudalism is one of the state’s regulatory tools for the development of endowment institutions with financial solvency, and a means to involve them in development, to establish facilities by investing endowment funds, whether in inhabited cities or in deserted remote areas, opening new investment horizons, and stimulating the construction of new housing and the manufacture of equipment, reclamation, and trading in it, encouraging immigration to it, and stimulating trade around its endowment institutions. This is because waqf institutions provide basic necessary services at no cost to the state. There for, the study discussed the possibility of compatibility of the concept of waqf and the concept of feudalism within its legal limits and their complementarity to achieve reconstruction. At the level of endowment management decisions or endowment investment management. Then the study concluded by presenting the experience of King Abdulaziz Endowment for Al Ain Al Azizia in Jeddah as a contemporary model for the integration between endowment and feudalism, mentioning the results and recommendations. © (2023), (Journal of King Abdulaziz University).

This paper aims to examine the long-run and short-run association between natural resource rent, financial development, and urbanization on carbon emission from the context of the USA during 1995–2015 with the help of a contemporary and innovative approach named quantile autoregressive distributed lagged model (QARDL). The stated approach is applied due to the fact that non-linearity is observed for the study variables. The findings indicated that the higher financial development (0.304), natural resource rent (0.102), and urbanization (0.489) have a positive impact on the environmental degradation in the region of USA during long-run estimation in the stated quantiles of the study. This would indicate that higher financial development, urbanization, and natural resources are putting more environmental pressure on the economy of the USA. Similarly, the findings under short-run estimation confirm that past and lagged values of carbon emission, financial development, natural resource rent, and urbanization are significantly determining the current values of the carbon emission. For this reason, it is suggested that the government requires some immediate steps of the USA to control the harmful effect of such financial development, more urbanization, and higher natural resource rent as well. This would indicate the reflection of some green strategies in all three explanatory variables to generate some fruitful environmental outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, the current performance shown by the global green sukuk market does not meet the expectation, whereas the limited amount of studies providing clear evidence on the actual drivers impacting green sukuk issuance is an obstacle. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the drivers influencing green sukuk issuance and identify the mechanisms underlying each of these drivers in order to propose strategic actions geared for the policymakers to drive its presence. This was achieved through a qualitative case study conducted with the participation of green sukuk issuers in Malaysia. As a result, it was revealed that competitiveness, legitimation and ecological responsibility influenced the issuance of green sukuk. Hence, the findings may inspire the policymakers towards utilising the roles of green sukuk drivers and positioning a comprehensive attempt in boosting its presence. This can be potentially achieved by an increased amount of favourable legislative measures and applicable promotion and education strategies of the green agenda for a strengthened green sukuk market. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

How does their turn toward transnational religious giving influence their perception of the state’s responsibilities regarding social welfare provision? Based on ethnographic fieldwork research with registered non-profit organizations collecting and distributing Islamic alms (zakat and sadaqa) in the state of Uttar Pradesh, this article examines how local and transnational religious giving affects the ways in which members of these Muslim philanthropic organizations imagine citizenship and welfare responsibilities in India. Distributive practices within these organizations show a dual focus on fostering Muslims’ economic independence and self-sufficiency by mobilizing local and transnational charitable networks on the one hand and improving access to state welfare on the other. The co-existence of these somewhat divergent strategies suggests that while the state is considered partial and uncaring, it also remains viewed as an indispensable welfare provider. More generally, these observations bring forth a discussion on the extent and effects of the transnationalisation and privatisation of welfare in globally connected South-Asia. © The Author(s) 2022.},

Indonesian Muslims follow the idea of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) based on the Imam Syafi’i school of thought, whose principles are practiced in daily life and provide many positive teachings on nature as God’s creation. Humans are regarded as the khilafah fil al ard, stewards of the earth, and the Qur’an teaches that God has created everything in the heavens and on earth as ayat, the sign of God. In Indonesia, organizations and scholars have explored the potential of Islamic teachings for climate action in the form of fatwas (verdicts) and for awakening the people’s awareness of climate change through religious lectures. Government officials and green activists have worked in partnership with the Ulama Council of Indonesia, Muslim leaders, and communities to issue important fatwas on certain issues including forest burning and the protection of wildlife. The Islamic principles of charity and finance, such as zakat, infaq, shadaqah and waqf as well as green sukuk (Islamic bonds), are also beginning to be mobilized for climate change action, including forest conservation. A Sumatra tradition of lubuk larangan has been applied to managing river environments. These examples show the potential of Islamic teaching to promote values important for combating the climate crisis. © The Siam Society Under Royal Patronage 2023.},

To accomplish this, we utilized an advanced Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag model to scrutinize the short- and long-term quantile patterns for both the dependent and independent variables. The findings reveal that green technologies and natural resource rents play a negative role in reducing emissions, whereas economic growth and trade openness have positive effects on emissions levels in China in the short and long run during different quantile patterns. Additionally, we employed the Wald test to confirm the presence of asymmetric patterns in environmental pollution concerning economic growth, natural resource rents, green technological innovation, and trade openness in both the short and long terms.

By allowing fund allocation for a set period, temporary waqf holds significant potential for improving social welfare of the Muslim Community. It enables the use of funds to respond quickly to urgent and varied needs, such as infrastructure development and public facilities. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of temporary waqf in enhancing social welfare of the Muslim Community, focusing on fund allocation flexibility, investment efficiency, and positive economic impacts. The research adopts a library research approach, collecting and analyzi ng relevant literature on temporary waqf. Data are sourced from academic publications, regulatory documents, and waqf management-related reports. The analysis examines how temporary waqf affects the execution of social and economic projects and its overall influence on the community. Results indicate that temporary waqf allows for more adaptable and responsive fund allocation, accelerating the implementation of both social and economic programs. Temporary waqf funds can be invested in productive projects that generat e immediate benefits, such as building infrastructure and healthcare facilities. These projects contribute to improving the quality of life, stimulating local economic growth, and creating employment opportunities. The study suggests raising public awareness about t emporary waqf, formulating supportive policies, and promoting collaboration with the private sector and financial institutions. By implementing these recommendations, temporary waqf can further maximize its impact, enhance fund management efficiency, and contribute to sustainable development across Muslim Community. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {With the recent implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and its stringent environmental regulations, interest is growing in comprehending the intricate relationship between economic growth, energy minerals, globalization, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions within the NAFTA bloc. This study reexamines the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, focusing on the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United States concerning energy minerals (such as natural gas), globalization, and CO2 emissions. To analyze this relationship, the Quantile Autoregressive Lag (QARDL) method is employed from 1990Q1 to 2018Q4. The findings justify the EKC hypothesis from lower to middle quantiles in the case of the Canadian economy. However, in the case of Mexico and the USA, the EKC hypothesis is valid from median to higher quantiles. For the Canadian case, the coefficients of natural gas are positive and significant from lower to median quantiles, indicating that energy minerals are positively linked to CO2 emissions in Canada. The positive nexus between energy minerals and carbon footprint is validated from lower to higher quantiles in the Mexican economy, whereas for the USA case, the positive association only holds in the median quantiles. Moreover, globalization significantly increases environmental degradation in Canada and the USA, while it is insignificant in Mexico. Overall, our findings unveil the existing asymmetries in the association between the designated variables and stress how heterogeneities can be a critical factor in environmental research, indicating the need for sustainable climate models based on reliable forecasting. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This research aims to evaluate the potential implementation of forest endowments (waqf) through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The study employs two methodologies: a comprehensive SWOT analysis to examine internal and external factors and the Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) and External Factor Evaluation (EFE) methods within the SWOT matrix framework. Data were gathered via questionnaires distributed to representatives of environmental care communities. The findings indicate that internal factors, particularly potential strengths, support the implementation of waqf forests. Internal and external factors contribute to these strengths, enhancing the potential for successful implementation. Weaknesses can be mitigated by leveraging existing strengths. External factors are categorized into opportunities, which can promote the development of waqf forest strategies, and threats, which necessitate strategic interventions. The analysis reveals that the strength factor scores higher overall than the weakness factor, suggesting a promising outlook for successful implementation. These research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of waqf forest implementation by thoroughly analyzing the relevant internal and external factors. The identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats provide valuable guidance for stakeholders aiming to optimize the use of waqf forests for environmental conservation and sustainable management. © 2024 The authors.},

Methodologically, the study employs a comparative qualitative analysis based on secondary data from academic literature, government reports, and institutional publications. The results show, first, Malaysia employs a centralized and technologically integrated approach, ensuring transparency and efficiency in zakat collection and distribution. In contrast, Turkey adopts a decentralized model driven by non-governmental organizations and community participation, fostering flexibility but posing challenges in standardization and oversight. Indonesia's hybrid model combines governmental oversight with private sector involvement, aiming to balance regulatory control with local adaptability, yet needs help in coordination and public trust. Second, the policy enhancements such as improved coordination mechanisms, strengthened regulatory frameworks, and enhanced public awareness to optimize Zakat's role in poverty alleviation and social welfare across Malaysia, Turkey, and Indonesia.

Applying the standard event study methodology, it finds that stock returns respond positively and significantly to the announcements of green sukuk issuance, suggesting that investors perceive and react favorably to the announcement. This significantly positive response is observed both for the individual firm (through CARs) and for a sample of all firms (through CAARs). Thus, it can be concluded that investors benefit from the announcements of green sukuk issuance. Further, this study draws a comparative analysis of investors' response to the announcements of corporate green sukuk and corporate green bond issuance, and the findings also show that investors respond positively to the announcements of green bond issuances. However, the investors' response is slightly higher to the announcements of corporate green sukuk issuance compared to corporate green bonds, and the investors get slightly more benefit from green sukuk issuance as compared to green bond issuance. These finding inform policymakers for the formulation of strategies to attract investors by integrating green bonds with shariah principles to fund environment-friendly projects and consequently mitigate the climate change risk. © 2024 Bank Indonesia Institute.

Design/methodology/approach: This study empirically examined the beliefs and expectations on the proposed WIIGM model, which was adapted from the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Data was collected from 366 respondents selected via convenience sampling. Questionnaires were distributed online, of which responses were then analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling for hypothesis testing. Ethical approval is also gathered before the data collection begins. Findings: This study found that collaboration for investment and governance significantly contribute to sustainable income generation in waqf operations and management, which eventually results in the community’s trust and acceptance of the WIIGM model. Technology advancement also significantly influences sustainable income generation, which finally leads to the community's behavioural intention to participate in the WIIGIM model. Further studies on this variable may establish findings from other perspectives. Practical implications: This paper is an original study that empirically examines the potential for a new waqf integrated income-generating model in building the trust of the community towards waqf institutions. This study is significantly important for practitioners and policymakers in evaluating the potential roles of waqf based on the belief and trust of the community.

	abstract = {This paper proposes sovereign climate-aligned bonds (SCBs) as an innovation that could mobilise climate investment towards developing countries. The research focuses on identifying the mechanisms underlying the issuance of SCBs in developing countries to unlock climate investment from capital markets and what they imply for facilitating just transitions. The research bridges scholarship across three fields: policy innovation, climate finance and just transitions, undertaking semi-structured interviews in two samples: SCB direct managers and intermediary and expert organisations. Drawing on Seychelles's blue bond and Indonesia's green sukuk as case studies, the research found that gaps in the public budgets of both countries were the main triggers for issuing SCBs and internationally, the influence of international organisations (World Bank and UNDP). Domestically, national wealth, access to international markets, alignment of the instruments' characteristics with political agendas and compatibility with regulations were key factors. SCB benefits, such as capital mobilisation, new investors and transparency, were perceived to outweigh additionality concerns or reputational risks (though higher transaction costs compared with non-green issuances remained a consideration). SCBs may be used as political statements in support of climate agendas, surpassing the perceived benefits of the mobilised capital. A legacy of exclusive dynamics in private markets remains a structural barrier for SCBs to be transformational in addressing climate change. Risk-return rationales and the exclusion of climate from countries’ risk profiling place developing countries in a more challenging position. While these instruments may not be sufficient to close the climate investment gap, they have an important role to play. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Environment-related innovations are widely appreciated as a vital factor in achieving sustainable development goals, and stability in the financial sector can help boost the output of environmental innovations by removing financial constraints. Hence, the primary aim of the analysis is to investigate the impact of financial stability on environmental innovation in China by using the QARDL model over the period 1995Q1-2020Q4. The study's main findings confirm the positive role of financial stability on environmental innovation in both the short and long run. Wald test also confirms the asymmetric impact of financial stability on environmental innovation in the short and long run. Moreover, the long-run impacts of GDP, R&D activities, and environmental policy stringency on environmental innovation are positive. In the short run, the estimates of research and development and environmental policy stringency are positively significant at higher quantiles only. Based on the findings, our research will help policymakers to develop valuable policies for financial stability to enhance environmental innovation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Concerns about a sustainable environment are increasing and have attained significant attention among policy experts worldwide. Therefore, the current research investigated to what extent financial innovations, green energy, and economic growth impacted Indian transport-based carbon (TCO2) emissions from 1990 to 2018. This research applied quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) model and the Wald test for parameter consistency. The QARDL approach proves valuable as it illustrates the causal patterns across different quantiles of financial innovations, green energy, economic growth, and environmental degradation. It offers a more comprehensive understanding of the overall relationships among these variables, which conventional methods such as ARDL and OLS often overlook. The outcomes reveal that financial innovation and green energy negatively affect TCO2 emissions, suggesting that transportation sector emissions will likely decline because of a rise in green energy and financial innovation. In contrast, GDP positively affects TCO2 emissions which deteriorate the environment. Furthermore, the findings of GDP2 found significant and negative effects on TCO2 for all quantiles, affirming the inverse U-shaped curve for the Indian economy. Overall, the study suggests that Indian governments should promote the development of green financial innovation and focus their priorities on sustainable energy to attain carbon neutrality and sustainable development goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments all over the globe to bring radical changes to all walks of life. Strict lockdowns are not only adversely affecting the social, economic, and psychological wellbeing of individuals but also questioning the sustainability of most businesses. In wake of the current scenario, this study is aimed at exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing the sustainability of entrepreneurship particularly from a female perspective and further providing insights into the role of Islamic financial institutions in the sustainability of businesses during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study that takes social constructivism approach to study the underlying phenomenon. Semi-structured interviews are conducted to collect primary data. Secondary data are also utilized in this study to theoretically define various concepts relating to entrepreneurial sustainability. The application of thematic analysis revealed various risks associated with sustainability. The interviews reveal the ground realities and tell us about the hardships being faced by the entrepreneurs due to ongoing crises. The participants of the study also shed light on the role of Islamic financial institutions during the pandemic. Findings: The study results revealed that it may look impossible for women entrepreneurs to halt or avoid the adverse consequences of the pandemic; however, a few female entrepreneurs strived to guard their existing portfolios with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. Whereas, several women, especially those running home-based businesses, lost their income streams. Despite these rapid challenges, most female entrepreneurs are working on inventive online systems to sustain their business activities during the crisis. Finally, guidelines are suggested which can help achieve sustainability of the entrepreneurial startups. Research limitations/implications: The outcomes of this study are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and Islamic financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during severe disasters like COVID-19. Moreover, the study is a helpful tool for women entrepreneurs to avert the worst impact of the pandemic with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. The themes of this study help generate realistic information to appraise the strategies to create facilitating business environments that drive the women to carry out the entrepreneurial activity during any crisis like the COVID-19. Practical implications: The results of this study provide evidence that crisis can be anticipated up to some extent if entrepreneurs become able to take proactive decisions in case of expected or identifiable threats. The study may also help the women entrepreneurs to comprehend the serious consequences of the pandemic by shifting their mode of financing to Islamic finance. Although this pandemic is a cause of physical discomfort instead this research may encourage the female entrepreneurs not to lose heart, just find the potential opportunities for their home-based and small businesses and manage funding from the Islamic microfinance institutions. Originality/value: The study adds to the existing literature on entrepreneurial sustainability with a particular focus on the role of Islamic microfinance institutions for women entrepreneurs' sustainability in Pakistan. Secondly, the study employs the entrepreneurial sustainability model (ESM) that, according to the best of our knowledge, has not been used by the researchers earlier to study the given research phenomenon. Thirdly, the study findings are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during disasters like COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The limited funds available for waqf-based forest development require nazhir to carefully choose the best location so that the asset can function optimally. However, no specific research has been conducted to guide the selection of the best location for this purpose. This study aimed to identify potential criteria to help determine the best site for developing a waqf-based forest. Several methods were used to collect the necessary data, including literature reviews, in-depth interviews, field observations, and focus group discussions. This study identifies four crucial criteria when selecting the best locations: a) legal, b) physical and biophysical, c) high conservation value and benefits, and d) management. In addition, each criterion has sub-criteria. Among all, legal issues receive the highest highlight as unresolved regulations can affect a forest's ownership and function. This study was the first to discuss these criteria. Future research should quantify the criteria suggested using GIS and conduct more field observations in existing waqf-based forests in Indonesia. © 2024 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

In contrast, economic policy uncertainty hurts sustainable development in the short and long run in China, while in the USA, only the long-run negative association between the two variables is observed.

Likewise, the adoption of environmental technologies helps improve environmental quality, which positively impacts mental and physical health and thus increases the sense of well-being and happiness. Therefore, the main focus of the study is to analyze the influence of financial services and environmental technologies on happiness. For analyzing the short and long-run impacts of financial services and environmental technologies on happiness, we have utilized the ARDL model and QARDL models. The findings of the ARDL model confirm the positive influence of financial services, environmental technologies, national income, financial development, and education on happiness in the short and long term. Similarly, the QARDL model also suggests the favorable long-run effects of financial services and environmental technologies on happiness at most quantiles. The long-run Wald test confirms the asymmetric influence of all variables on happiness, while in the short-term, excluding education, all other variables exert asymmetric impacts on happiness. Thus, to promote happiness, policymakers should try to increase the role of internet-based financial services and increases investment in research and development activities to enhance environment-related technologies.

	abstract = {resour. ce rich economies are the major contributors of global pollution due to over use of natural resources. The extraction of natural resources not only contaminates environment but also create ecological imbalance. Also, in the quest for economic expansion, countries tend to fuel their economies with cheaper energy resources as it may excel their revenue source. Considering the issue, the study intends to investigate the feasibility of Fintech industry for sustainable economic growth. In addition to this, green growth and natural resources are also considered a prompter of sustainable economic growth. Therefore, the present study explores the nexus among natural resources, green growth, fintech and sustainable economic growth in the context of China. The study used water levels, energy consumption and air pollution to develop an index for green growth. Dataset from 2000 to 2022 was extracted from World Development Indicator to determine the associations among the variables. For a robust analysis, the study employed the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model to account for asymmetric impacts of the predictors on the dependent variable. The findings provided evidence into the long-run associations between the variables. The lagged value of green growth positively and significantly impacts sustainable economic growth whereas FinTech was found to exert a positive and significance influence on sustainable economic growth. Moreover, lagged value of natural resources were also positively and significantly associated with sustainable economic growth. However, in terms of short-run impact, the analysis did not support presence of short-run influences of the predictors of sustainable economic growth. Model's adequacy and reliability was ensured by testing for autocorrelation with results confirming the absence of autocorrelation. The study contributes to existing literature by using methodological advancements in examination of dynamic association among economic factors and consequently, provides meaningful implications for policymakers. © 2024},

Therefore, both developed and developing economies focus on digitalization to cope with carbon neutrality targets. Thus, this study attempted to generate a meaningful relationship between the digital economy and green energy, innovation, and environmental tax policy to capture the role of factors in acquiring carbon neutrality. For the abovementioned objectives, modern econometric methods, such as the Kilian bias-adjusted bootstrap, were adopted to evaluate the Chinese dataset between 1990 and 2021. The results indicate that the study factors play a significant role in acquiring carbon neutrality in the long-term Chinese economy. Furthermore, quantile autoregressive distributed lag model (QARDL) indicates that all the factors influence carbon neutrality in various quantiles. Consequently, the digital economy, green energy and innovation, and environmental taxes significantly assist in attaining carbon neutrality in the long term, and the ecological Kuznets curve prevails in the economy. Therefore, radical and wide-ranging policy implications are required in many areas including environmental restrictions, digital economy promotion, green and sustainable technologies, and clean energy sources. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to find empirical evidence related to the influence of organisational capability and social capability on organisational sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation (OPZ). This study also wants to prove that OPZ's social capability can moderate the influence of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. Theoretical Framework: Providing professional organisational capacity is a form of OPZ's responsibility to improve the community's welfare through trustworthy zakat management. Thus, achieving organisational goals requires the importance of organisational capacity. Based on the stewardship theory, management is not motivated by individual goals but instead focuses on their primary goal for the organisation's benefit. Method: The methodology used in this study is a quantitative approach and the data analysis was carried out with the Moderated Regression Analysis model. Results and Discussion: The results of the research reveal that both organisational capacity and social capability have a positive influence on organisational sustainability. Furthermore, social capabilities have a positive moderating effect on the effect of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. The test results show that the moderation in this study is included in the type of quasi-moderation. Research Implications: The results imply that the organisational capacity and social capability of OPZs have an essential role in determining organisational sustainability, where the social capability of amil zakat agencies becomes a determinant to strengthening organisational capacity in supporting the sustainability of amil zakat agencies. Originality/Value: This research provides new insights into the role of organisational capacity and social capability in achieving sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation. This study aligned with SDG 1 (No Poverty) by enhancing the management of Zakat funds to improve community welfare. © 2024, Editora Alumni In. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Green finance is an organized financial activity meant to improve the environment. Regardless of its critical role in mitigating climate change, green finance faces a significant investment shortfall. Green financing is a feasible way to close the gap in green investment. Despite the potential benefits of green finance in green renewable energy technologies, this study topic has received little attention. Investment in green energy projects draws attention since it eliminates the negative consequences of fossil fuels while also conserving the environment. This research looks into the nexus between investments in green finance, renewable energy consumption, carbon dioxide, foreign direct investment, remittances, inflation, gross fixed capital formation, trade openness, and human capital for the OECD-15 European countries, utilizing newly developed “Residual Augmented Least Squire” (RALS) cointegration technique and the QARDL model for the period spanning from 1990 to 2020. In empirical results, the RALS cointegration test confirms the cointegration link between the studied antecedents. Additionally, “Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag Mondel” (QARDL) empirical estimates show that the lag of renewable energy consumption, foreign direct investment, gross capital creation, trade openness, and human capital all have substantial influence on green finance investment. Carbon dioxide emissions and inflation, on the other hand, are proven to be adversely related. However, remittances have a negligible relationship with green finance investment. The results of this research provide insightful information on the state of green finance investments now and their requirements in the future. These insights will be beneficial for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners as they work towards enhancing and advocating for the implementation of green finance investment initiatives and endeavors aimed at mitigating climate change. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how industrialization, financial development, electricity consumption, trade openness, and green FinTech affect on carbon emissions asymmetrically in Asian countries. Design: Method/Approach: The study examined 29 years of panel data from 39 Asian countries from 1995 to 2022, sourced from World Development Indicators (WDI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The study constructs a green financial technology index using principal component analysis (PCA). The study utilizes an Asymmetric Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributive Lag (A-QARDL) model with pooled mean group (PMG) specifications to explore effects that exhibit cross-sectional homogeneous in the long-run, but heterogeneous in the short-run effects. Findings: Industrialization and financial development have a strongly asymmetric impact on carbon emissions. Industrialization causes an increase in carbon emissions at various quantiles, while green FinTech plays a crucial role in mitigating these carbon emissions. Trade openness and domestic credit to the private sector also help reduce carbon emissions. Research limitations and implications: The study emphasizes the significance of employing green FinTech techniques and using renewable energy sources to meet sustainable industrialization and sustainability goals in Asian countries. The policy consequences include promoting environmentally friendly industrial practices, encouraging green financial investments, and boosting government financing for private sector research and development to mitigate carbon emissions. Originality/value: The study employs robust modeling to analyze the role of green FinTech to enhance industrial sustainability. Both Industrialization and deindustrialization have an impact on economic emissions, and the potential of green FinTech's to promote sustainability contributes to the environment protection strategy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

We employ cointegration association in the long run among the variables, and the results of the two models confirm this. Findings reveal that circular economy and climate policy stringency significantly negatively impact carbon emissions. On the other hand, the energy transition, industrialization, and supply chain pressures are crucial to determining CO2 emissions in the short and long run. The finding further explores that municipal waste generation recycling is considerable at the mean and upper 90th quantiles than the lower quantile. Therefore, the empirical results of the current study provide acumens for policymakers of advanced economies and emerging markets to maintain the balance among circular economy, energy transition, environmental policy stringency, and supply chain pressure for reducing CO2 emissions without halting economic growth and sustainable development.

	abstract = {Considering how crucial environmental quality is to development, production often takes precedence over the development process when certain macroeconomic policies are being implemented. This phenomenon has been the subject of several studies conducted in various regions and nations. In this context, the recent article explores the nonlinear effects of industrial output, renewable energy, technological innovations, energy efficiency, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in the top ten industrialized countries. It recommends contradictory policy approaches due to its reported conflicting outcomes, opening up new research directions. To this end, the study relies on advanced econometric tools such as panel QARDL (Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag) and the nonparametric quantile Granger causality (NPQGC) test to attain robust results. The findings suggest that industrial output and urbanization significantly deteriorate environmental quality by increasing CO2 emissions across various time horizons. However, renewable energy, technological innovations, and energy efficiency have a significant influence towards enhancing environmental quality. Notably, industrialization and urbanization become environmentally friendly when energy efficiency is integrated with these variables. Additionally, the NPQGC test supports the main results by confirming the Granger causality between the modelled series. Based on the outcomes, the study suggests that the integration of energy efficiency with industrialization and urbanization can significantly contribute to achieving a sustainable environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Islamic finance’s focus on social inclusion and development makes it ideal for achieving the 2030 agenda. The purpose of this study is to explore how Islamic finance, specifically Sukuk (Islamic Bond), anticipates post-SDGs 2030 in its own way. The systematic literature review is employed in this study to discover, assess, and analyze every relevant piece of research that has been published yet in order to provide answers to the research questions. We selected articles from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases that met standard eligibility criteria. To analyze the data, researchers used Covidence as a tool to accelerate this systematic review. Our analysis revealed that, to anticipate post-SDGs, Sukuk as one of the Islamic finance products contributes to increased economic and business activity that has an impact on climate change, reducing extreme poverty and inequality. In addition, Islamic finance is also capable of ensuring financial and social stability as well as promoting better and equal human development. The Shariah principles inherent in it have an important contribution to sustainable and equitable development. Thus, development is expected to be more inclusive and sustainable like SDGs’ ambition of “no one left behind”. Objective: To explore how Islamic finance, specifically Sukuk, anticipates post-SDGs 2030 in its own way. Method: This research uses qualitative methods. The systematic literature review is employed in this study to discover, assess, and analyze every relevant piece of research that has been published yet in order to provide answers to the research questions. Results and Discussion: The results revealed that, to anticipate post-SDGs, Sukuk as one of the Islamic finance products contributes to increased economic and business activity that has an impact on climate change, reducing extreme poverty and inequality.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use several model specifications. The specifications mainly take the BWM’s characteristics and governance into account. The authors use a standard-panel data approach with a fixed-effects model as the Hausman test result favors the fixed-effects model. The authors collected monthly data from the Indonesia Financial Services Authority for the period 2018–2020. The detailed data, 39 BWM enabling us to observe the financial, social and governance elements of BWMs. Findings: The results reveal interesting findings. The authors find that BWM characteristics, governance and social capital are significant in shaping BWM’s sustainability, performance and risk. Furthermore, the authors find that BWM located in a province with higher lending density has lower performance than those located in a province with lower lending density. The results provide some evidence on how waqf-based microfinance could achieve both economic and social goals. It could provide perspectives for stakeholders in designing microfinance institutions. Originality/value: This paper is the first to empirically study the waqf-based microfinance institutions in Indonesia by looking at the determinants of performance and sustainability of those institutions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To cope up with the environmental issues, countries have adopted various measures out of which technological advancement and green finance are gaining particular importance. The present study thus aims at estimating the effect of technological advancements and green finance on environmental sustainability measured by ecological footprints under STIRPAT model in Indonesia. Time series data spanning over 1995–2020 period is collected from different secondary sources and empirical analysis is done by applying Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model. The findings indicate the positive contribution of technological advancement measured by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and green finance in environmental sustainability over whole range of quantiles (0.05–0.90) in the short as well as in the long run. However, economic growth and urbanization are found to pose serious threats to the environmental sustainability as they have positive association with ecological footprints at different quantiles. The findings suggest the Indonesian government to pay attention to significant fruitful policies aimed at the promotion of green finance and ICT technologies to ensure environmental sustainability in Indonesia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Zakat is an important Islamic economic instrument that plays significant role in Sustainable Development Goals. Accordingly, Zakat Institutions must manage zakat in a proper and efficient manner. This study aims to examine the efficiency of Zakat Institutions based on their clusters which are government, business and social organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses three quantitative methods: data envelopment analysis (DEA), free disposal hull and super-efficiency DEA. The analytical method is based on production approach, variable return to scale assumption and output orientation. The sample consists of 14 Zakat Institutions from three clusters: Zakat Institutions managed by government, Zakat Institutions managed by corporation and Zakat Institution managed by social organizations. Findings: The results revealed that all of three techniques culminate the same ranking order of efficiency. Zakat Institution managed by the government is the most efficient Zakat Institution, with the average value of 0.87 by using three approaches combined. Meanwhile, Zakat Institutions owned by company and social institutions cluster are in second and third position, with the average value of 0.65 and 0.4, respectively, based on the results of the three approaches. This study contends that the level of efficiency of Zakat Institutions may be supported by clusters (affiliations) in their management. Research limitations/implications: This study’s limitation is the inadequacy of the required data. Nonetheless, this study provides insights to improve the efficiency of Zakat Institutions based on their clusters. Zakat Institutions in each cluster can improve their efficiency by optimizing inputs to produce multiple outputs. Originality/value: This study enhances research on the efficiency of Zakat Institutions using three methods to assess the consistency and strength of Zakat Institutions’ efficiency values. In addition, this study examines the efficiency level of Zakat Institutions based on their clusters. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study utilizes the two latest indices of financial stress and economic policy uncertainty to evaluate their impacts on crude oil prices, which have yet to be investigated in the case of France and Germany. The findings reveal that oil prices significantly influence financial stress and economic policy uncertainty, with the effects being exacerbated before and after COVID-19. Oil prices had a positive and significant impact on financial stress in both countries, with the impact being more pronounced in Germany. Additionally, oil prices have a positive association with economic policy uncertainty, particularly within the lower quantiles of both France and Germany. This study highlights the importance of understanding the complex relationships among oil prices, economic policy uncertainty, and financial stress, especially in the context of the non-financial sector and its connection to financial stability.

The study objectively analyzes the effects of environmental policy, natural resources, fintech, and green technologies on CO2 emissions and green growth employing the QARDL method. By confirming the empirical outcomes, the research analyzes the reliability of the methodology. The green growth and CO2 emissions models yield distinct results about statistically significant quantile ranges and coefficient magnitudes, as demonstrated by the research's findings. Natural resources support escalating CO2 emissions, whereas environmental policy, green technologies, and finance tend to lessen the detrimental effects.

Using time series data in four issuing countries (from January 2018 until December 2022) with an autoregressive distributed lag in the panel model approach. The findings show that in the long and short term, global green sukuk can reduce the adverse effects of climate change in the issuing country. However, economic growth affects increasing carbon emissions in the issuing country in the long term, while trade openness has no effect on climate change. To support sustainable economic development as evidenced by increased economic growth, it must be balanced with increased issuance of global green sukuk financing issues to reduce the adverse effects of climate change in issuing countries. © 2024, Econjournals.

The core focus of the existing paper is to demystify the influences of green finance, green energy on environmental dynamics in Malaysia covering the timeframe from 1990 to 2018. To this end, we employ the QARDL technique to peruse the effect of green finance, renewable energy, and economic growth on CO2 emissions and ecological footprint separately. By doing so, we crosscheck the empirical outcomes and inspect the consistency of the analysis. Firstly, empirical results show that the ecological footprint model yields similar results to the CO2 emissions model in terms of statistically significant quantile ranges and the magnitude of the coefficients. According to the overall results, GDP increases environmental degradation while green finance and renewable energy have a mitigating role. Finally, we confirm a significant EKC hypothesis for Malaysia. Based on these findings, we recommend Malaysian policymakers focus on energy efficiency, realize financial reforms and promote green energy through the financial system to achieve the 2050 net-zero emission target. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Food security is crucial on a global scale as it provides essential health, social, and economic advantages to the human population. Therefore, to achieve the sustainable development goal of zero hunger (Goal 2), it is imperative to assess the progress of food security, particularly in developing countries. Thus, this reflects on the relative factors affecting food security in Nigeria from 1980 to 2022. The study utilized advanced econometrics approaches such as Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) and Wavelet Coherence (WTC) to analyze the data. Food security is measured using the food production index (FPI), while other variables such as globalization (GLOB), population growth (POP), gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of economic growth, and inflation are considered. The results of the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag analysis indicate that in the short-term, globalization has a beneficial impact on FPI at the 0.25 quantile, but it has a detrimental effect on food security at the 0.50 and 0.75 quantiles. Nevertheless, over a prolonged period, the effect is detrimental in all quantiles. Additionally, in the short-term, FPI experiences a beneficial effect from GDP in all quantiles. Over time, GDP has a positive effect on all levels of income distribution. However, in the short-term, the size of the POP has a negative effect on FPI for the 0.25 to 0.75 quantiles. Further discussion is dedicated to policy options and their implications. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The Bajo tribe is a traditional fishing community in Bone Regency, South Sulawesi, which faces the challenge of persistent poverty in various aspects. The National Zakat Amil Agency (BAZNAS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion has taken important steps to empower this community through educational values-based programs. This research aims to analyze the role of collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA in efforts to empower the coastal communities of the Bajo Tribe through the utilization of zakat. This research uses empirical legal methods using empowerment theory. Community development and empowerment aims to change community conditions for the better, in educational, economic, social, cultural, and political aspects. Data was collected by means of in-depth interviews with BAZNAS, KUA, and the Bajo tribal community, while literature studies referred to relevant articles, books and research reports. The research results show that the collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA has contributed to changing the mindset of the Bajo Tribe in educating the Bajo Tribe community so that they improve spiritually, health and religious education. The challenges faced are the lack of realization of more massive program sustainability and the lack of active involvement of the community, stakeholders and the importance of realizing community empowerment through zakat environmental development in accordance with the BAZNAS RI program which is intended for community groups who experience economic, educational, health, spiritual and economic disadvantage welfare. Even though the results are not optimal, this contribution should be appreciated because it has had a significant impact on empowering the Bajo ethnic community on the Bone coast of South Sulawesi. © 2024, State Islamic University of Ar-Raniry Faculty of Sharia and Law.

	abstract = {Research on waqf sustainability is increasing in popularity, showing exponential growth in publication and citation numbers. The realm of research has grown intricate and fragmented, thereby posing a growing challenge to the regulation of waqf sustainability. The main purpose of this study is to organise and integrate the preliminary studies on the theme of waqf sustainability. To this end, this study involved bibliometric analysis, distinguishing it from previous analyses, which were outdated and/or different focus. We collected 84 articles extracted from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, covering 20 years from 2001 to 2022. The findings showed that the most prolific authors were from Malaysia. There are five research themes regarding waqf sustainability, including the accountability of Islamic social finance as a third-sector economy, the sustainability of Islamic microfinance, the role of intellectual capital in waqf institutions, the effectiveness of management, and the performance measurement of waqf institutions. This study shows that the performance of waqf institutions for waqf sustainability is scant. Hence, there is an important research gap that can be addressed in future research since sustainability is a priority agenda as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) blueprint. © 2024 Vika Annisa Qurrata, Muhammad Hakimi Mohd.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing evidence for a “greenium” in the primary Sukuk market. The term “greenium” is defined in the study as the lower cost of capital or reduced yields that green Sukuk may offer compared to non-green Sukuk, reflecting investor willingness to accept lower returns for green investments. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of “greenium” as an incentive for issuers to fund eco-friendly projects, contributing to a sustainable environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses propensity score matching techniques to provide an accurate comparison of pricing differences between green and non-green Sukuk issued in global primary markets during the period 2017–2022. Findings: The results reveal that green Sukuk signify a “greenium” effect. This suggests that investors find green Sukuk attractive, willing to accept lower returns. Given the positive investor response to green initiatives in the market, issuers can capitalize on the growing demand for green Sukuk, leading to low-cost funding. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution to the literature at the interface of Islamic finance and environmental sustainability. In particular, it stands out by focusing on the pricing dynamics in the green Sukuk market and highlights the potential benefits of issuing green Sukuk to help achieve sustainability goals while providing access to lower cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, this study examines the dynamic connectedness between sukuk (Islamic bonds), green sukuk, Islamic equities, and Islamic green markets for equity by comparing both in the short and long terms spillover and examining the effects of uncertainty factors on dynamic connectedness at different spillover horizons. In the short run, green Islamic equities, green sukuk and sukuk are net transmitters, and Islamic equities are net receivers. However, in the medium and long term, the behavior of these markets is vice versa. We then find the determinants of connectivity levels using macroeconomic conditions. We find that some of the determinants that cause return spillover in the short and medium term are quite different from those that cause return spillover in the long term. The results of portfolio analysis show that green sukuk are effective in hedging the risks of Islamic equities, green Islamic equities and sukuk. The performance characteristics of these potential diversification and risk mitigation benefits have been robust and enduring during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War. Finally, our findings are of great importance to investors interested in ethical investing and for policymakers to maintain a healthy and resilient financial system. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Suppressed demand arises from inadequate energy access, resulting in unmet basic needs. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of the informal economy, rising temperatures, and electricity transmission losses on suppressed demand in Ghana from 2000 to 2020, using a quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) approach. The study forecasts suppressed demand using Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios, offering insights for energy system planning. The results indicate that all the variables significantly affect suppressed demand in the mid-quantiles. Notably, transmission losses and growth of informal economy variables significantly impact suppressed demand within the 50th to 75th quantiles but have minimal impact before the 50th and after the 75th quantiles in the long run. Additionally, rising temperatures substantially increase suppressed demand by increasing electricity demand for cooling. All future scenarios project this growth trend will continue through 2050, albeit at varying rates. In the business-as-usual (BAU) case, suppressed demand is expected to steadily increase from 1782 MW in 2020 to 8636 MW in 2050. This trajectory aligns well with historical growth trends, which saw suppressed demand increase from 659 GWh to 1782 GWh between 2000 and 2020. SSP scenarios suggest that suppressed demand could grow substantially through 2050, driven by high losses and informal sector growth. Despite sustainable development narratives like SSP1, suppressed demand remains high without major grid and governance improvements. Comparing the results with past studies shows that our findings align with previous research but provide more nuanced insights by incorporating the effects of the informal economy and using advanced forecasting techniques. Practical policy implications include investing in green infrastructure, upgrading grid infrastructure, and formalising the informal economy to alleviate suppressed demand. These actions are critical for sustainable energy access and meeting future electricity needs effectively. © 2024},

	abstract = {Many researches have been conducted to provide theoretical explanations and/or empirical evidence of how globalization affects environmental quality. However, theoretical explanations have not reached consensus, empirical research has not yet clarified the possible effects in developing countries particularly. For Saudi Arabia from 1981 to 2018, we tested the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis (EKC). We studied the impact of globalization on the ecological footprint (ECP) relying on the QARDL approach. Four globalization indicators are used namely: social (GLOBS), economic (GLOBE), political (GLOBP), and total globalization (GLOBG). Based on QARDL results, it appears that all quantiles show a statistically significant and negative sign for error correction parameter. These results affirm that the related variables and ecological footprint in Saudi Arabia are reverting to a long-term equilibrium. In the long-run, the results of the study suggest that GLOBG, as well as GLOBE, will lead to increased ECP across all the quantiles. However, the fluctuations in GLOBP and GLOBS negatively affect ecological footprint in higher quantiles. Additionally, the QARDL results confirmed that the Saudi economy has an inverted U-Shaped curve. In the short-run, ECP is negatively affected by four globalization indicators in middle and upper quantiles. Sustainable development and environmental policy can be advanced using the guidelines found in this research. Based on the findings, the government and political system in Saudi Arabia should pay more attention to global and economic globalization to achieve sustainable environmental goals in the long run. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate the application of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory, along with the stewardship concept, in the context of zurri waqf reporting. The study aims to address the current lack of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf and explore how these accounting theories can contribute to establishing appropriate accounting principles and ensuring accountability, thereby supporting the achievement of SDG. Theoretical Framework: The theoretical framework of this paper is grounded in positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory. Positive accounting theory seeks to explain and predict accounting behaviors and events, emphasizing the importance of accurate and relevant information for decision-making. Decision usefulness theory focuses on the provision of useful information to stakeholders, such as investors and creditors, to facilitate informed decision-making. The concept of stewardship, which involves looking after and protecting resources on behalf of others, is also integral to this framework, particularly in the context of waqf zurri, aligning with the goals of SDG to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. Methodology: This conceptual paper employs a thematic analysis of related literature to explore the relevance and application of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory to zurri waqf reporting. By examining existing research and theoretical perspectives, the study seeks to identify key themes and insights that can inform the development of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf, contributing to the SDG 16 objective of promoting transparency and accountability. Results and Discussion: The analysis reveals that the principles of positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory are highly relevant to zurri waqf reporting. These theories provide a robust foundation for predicting and explaining accounting behaviors and events, highlighting the necessity of thorough and accurate reporting. The study also underscores the importance of stewardship in ensuring accountability by the parties responsible for managing zurri waqf properties and assets, thereby supporting the broader aim of SDG to strengthen institutions and ensure responsible management. Research Implications: The implications of this study emphasize the need for meticulous zurri waqf reporting, guided by essential accounting theories. By adopting these theories, organizations and individuals responsible for managing zurri waqf can enhance transparency, accountability, and the overall effectiveness of resource utilization, directly contributing to SDG. This study also contributes to the broader discourse on the role of accounting in non-profit and charitable activities, particularly within an Islamic context. Originality/Value: This paper offers original insights into the application of accounting theories to zurri waqf reporting, a relatively underexplored area in the existing literature. By integrating positive accounting theory, decision usefulness theory, and the concept of stewardship, the study provides a novel perspective on how these theoretical frameworks can address the challenges associated with the lack of standardized reporting practices for zurri waqf. The findings contribute to the development of more robust and accountable reporting mechanisms for waqf zurri, ultimately benefiting both endowers and beneficiaries and supporting the institutional integrity emphasized by SDG. © 2024, Editora Alumni In.

While one side vehemently defends using ICT to direct and carry out sustainable development, another strongly struggles to highlight its many drawbacks. Similarly, green technologies are also under the limelight for promoting sustainable development since these technologies combine economic growth and environmental conservation. The purpose of the study is to empirically estimate the effect of digital technologies and green technologies in sustainable development in China. Time series data spanning over 1995–2021 period is analyzed using recently introduced Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (QARDL). The findings of the study suggest that there exists positive association between digital technologies and sustainable development over (0.05–0.80) quantiles. The significant and positive association exists between green technologies and sustainable development at all quantiles (0.05–0.95). The study also finds positive and negative association of economic growth and urbanization respectively with sustainable development. The study results emphasize the limitations of conclusion of past studies and provide significant contributions by confirming that the associations among variables is quantile-dependent. The Wald test results also disprove the parameter constancy for the Chinese economy and the findings of Quantile Granger Causality prove the presence of bidirectional causal association between digital technologies, green technologies and sustainable development. The study recommends Chinese policy makers and government to adopt relevant policies to promote sustainable development by effectively utilizing digital and green technologies. © 2024, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

	abstract = {The tourism industry is among the largest contributor to the Malaysian and Indonesian economies. Aggressive measures have been taken to boost both countries as a leader in the tourism sector. To sustain the growing tourism industry, the government would have to increase its spending. Due to restricted budgetary resources, one choice for reducing government spending is to utilize the waqf model as an alternative mechanism that can assist the government in reducing spending. Waqf also aims to fulfill the social needs of the community besides it is an innovative way to fund the tourism industry without relying on government funding. Thus, this study attempts to address whether the waqf model can help the government of Malaysia and Indonesia to sustain the tourism industry. This study adopts the qualitative approach, through semi-structured interviews was conducted to generate items for a survey. Next, for quantitative, data were collected using an online questionnaire survey to gain input from a broader population. The sampling procedure adopted was purposive sampling. The study found that the waqf model can be used to sustain the tourism industry as well as waqf model can help the government reduce expenditure for the tourism industry. The contributions from the findings can be used by both countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, to enhance the application of the waqf model in many sectors, including tourism. This certainly will have major impacts on the economy for both countries. Therefore, it ensures long-term economic operations that will benefit communities and socio-economic activities. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Zakat is not merely a category of normative worship but also an aspect of mu’āmalah characterized by its adaptability. This notion is evident in the efforts of the National Zakat Agency (BAZNAS) of Kendal District to modernize zakat law, going far beyond what is stipulated in classical naṣ and fiqh. The modernization of zakat law at BAZNAS Kendal, the main focus of this article, is explored through empirical juridical research using a philosophical re-actualization approach, extensive interpretive analysis, and the theory of maqāṣidi ijtihād. The study finds that modernization is apparent in initiatives to mandate zakat from corporations as zakatable entities, with allocations for distribution in forms such as creative consumptive zakat for installing clean water facilities, creative productive zakat in the form of microfinance, and zakat for community development. Methodologically, Baznas Kendal employs the principles of maqāṣid al-shariֿ’ah, evident in its efforts to link normative zakat teachings (naṣ) with various dynamics of modern life (al-wāqi’) and considerations of social welfare as the essence of shari’a presence. Therefore, this study contributes to the reconstruction of pre-modern zakat law formulations whose conceptualization is no longer visible in the modern era into something more contextually meaningful, and it deepens the understanding of the conceptual framework for the modernization of zakat law that adheres to maqāṣid al-shariֿֿ’ah. Zakat bukan saja katagori ibadah kenormatifan yang given, melainkan juga mu’amalah dengan karakter adaptability (keberubahan). Anggapan ini terlihat dalam upaya Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (Baznas) Kabupaten Kendal memodernisasi hukum zakat jauh melampaui apa yang tertertuang dalam naṣ maupun fiqh klasik. Modernisasi hukum zakat di BAZNAS Kab. Kendal sebagai fokus utama dalam artikel ini menggunakan jenis penelitian yuridis empiris dengan pendekatan reaktualisasi filosofis dan analisis interpretatif ekstensif, dan teori ijtihād maqāṣidī. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa modernisasi hukum terlihat pada upayanya mewajibkan perusahaan sebagai objek yang dikenai zakat, sementara alokasi distribusinya dalam bentuk: zakat konsumtif kreatif berupa pemasangan saluran air bersih, dan produktif kreatif berupa zakat micro finance, serta zakat community development. Secara metodologis Baznas Kendal menggunakan dalil maqāṣid al-shari’a, hal ini terlihat pada upayanya mengaitkan antara ajaran normatif zakat (naṣ) dengan berbagai faktor dinamika kehidupan modern (al-wāqi’), serta pertimbangan kemaslatan sosial sebagai intisari kehadiran shari’a. Dengan demikian penelitian ini berkontribusi merekonstruksi formulasi hukum zakat pramodern yang konseptualisasinya tidak lagi visible di masa modern menjadi lebih memberi makna aplikasi kontekstualnya, serta memperdalam pemahaman kerangka konsepsional modernisasi hukum zakat berbasis maqāṣid al-shariֿֿ’ah. © 2024, null.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the COVID-19 impact on the sustainability of gharimin (genuine debtors) in Islamic financial institutions (IFI) in Malaysia. The analysis was further conducted to expand the interpretation of gharimin in zakat institutions (ZI) to use the role of zakat distribution during the post-pandemic period due to income shock and long-term unemployment. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative research approach with grounded theory analysis to integrate theoretical insights into the interpretation of gharimin and current practices from the perspectives of ZI and IFI. An in-depth interview with 18 informants was conducted, and data were collected from senior management positions in the zakat distribution department, academicians who are experts in the area of zakat, and heads of Shariah departments in IFI. Findings: Expanding the interpretation of gharimin could help ZI and IFI recover the sustainability of gharimin for preparedness during post-pandemic and any emergency crisis in the future. Practical implications: This study implies the potential role of ZI in combating the risk of defaulting debtors in IFI to prepare for pandemic recovery in the future. Social implications: The new interpretation assists gharimin in reducing the burden debt using the zakat fund and protects genuine debtors by preventing IFI from declaring default or bankruptcy. Originality/value: This study narrows the literature gaps about gharimin in IFI in the context of the pandemic. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is, perhaps, the first paper to present the expansion of interpretation for gharimin into mu’sir in IFI in Malaysia. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, an investigation was conducted by collecting primary data from 379 household heads to examine the impact of social safety nets on household-level food security in the Torghar district of Northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The comprehensive analysis encompassed the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels. The bivariate analysis revealed issues and shortcomings related to access to social safety nets, particularly within the Zakat system. These issues included corruption and nepotism, which hindered poverty alleviation strategies and the well-being of vulnerable households. Additionally, complex bureaucratic procedures and regulations impeded social interventions, and political factors posed a substantial obstacle. At the multivariate level, the study identified the specific factors contributing to food insecurity. Respondents from extended family systems, individuals aged between 46 and 55 years, and those with religious education were found to be more vulnerable to food insecurity. While social safety nets held promise for addressing food sustenance challenges among local low-income citizens, the negative impacts of political involvement, favoritism, and nepotism were evident and required urgent attention. These findings emphasize the need for coordinated efforts among the government, social safety net officials, and community to identify and rectify these existing issues. Fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility regarding the role and implementation of social safety nets towards achieving food security is crucial to enhancing their viability and effectiveness, ensuring continuous support for those in need. © 2023 by the authors.},

This research examines the philanthropy movement driven by agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga in the Langkat Regency, Indonesia. It adopts a qualitative approach, employing a phenomenological study through in-depth interviews. This research involved three key groups as research subjects: 10 amil zakāt (who are responsible for zakāt administration), 15 zakāt payers, and 35 zakāt recipients. The research findings reveal that philanthropic activities involving agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga can be categorized into consumption-oriented and production-oriented activities. In contrast to the traditional approach of distributing zakāt mainly to relieve financial burdens, Desa Mangga has adopted a more proactive strategy in managing agricultural zakāt funds. The funds are directed towards productive businesses such as palm sugar production, stalls, and farmland management. As achieving complete economic independence continues, the effective allocation of agricultural zakāt funds at Desa Mangga progressively empower recipients to become more economically self-reliant. Nevertheless, it is crucial to highlight that, in practice, the concept of empowerment within zakāt philanthropy at Desa Mangga has yet to reach its full potential. Charitable activities still dominate the distribution of zakāt funds, inadvertently fostering dependency among zakāt recipients. © The Authors.},

The study drew on scholarly publications including books and academic papers as well as primary sources about Imam Zarkasyi by utilizing a qualitative, descriptive, and explanatory research methodology. The findings revealed that Zarkasyi’s educational perspectives and personal experiences significantly influenced the modernization of the waqf-based educational system. Zarkasyi’s proposals to enhance the pondok system’s modernity were based on his thorough understanding of the country’s educational culture. In response to the Dutch colonial administration, private educational institutions were established in 1926. These institutions offered students, educators, and community members the chance to acquire essential life skills and values in a unique educational setting. To ensure the continuity of these institutions, Zarkasyi transformed them into publicly owned enterprises through waqf establishment in 1958. As a waqif, he allocated a substantial portion of his fortune to be shared collectively among his three brothers. Zarkasyi aimed to ensure the sustainability of this approach by incorporating waqf principles which include attitudes, abilities, and praiseworthy characteristics. His initiatives continue to serve as a pedagogical model for private schools in Indonesia. This success motivates others to emulate the waqf concept, thereby contributing to the restoration and development of Islamic civilization. © The Authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: Using judgemental sampling, a total of 275 waqifs participated in this work to identify their preference in donating their money to the facility should it is introduced. Using the developed waqf-based qardhul hassan scale (WAQASCALE), this study examined the preference accordingly. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS 27. Findings: The results obtained were as follows: the first factor considered by the waqifs in donating money was perceived household well-being, followed by perceived recipients’ welfare, perceived mankind benevolence and perceived Muslims’ community security. Research limitations/implications: The authors developed construct items that had generalisability issues as they were at the infancy stage of development among social finance scientists along with the narrow geographical constraint where the actual survey was conducted. Practical implications: The results were useful in giving new guidance to state governments and Islamic banks (IBs) in Malaysia to explore further this sort of facility for the improved well-being of those affected by COVID-19. Besides, sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as poverty, hunger and responsible consumption, among others can be addressed effectively for the mutual well-being of those affected by the health crisis in an effort of combating financial hardships in the meeting of basic needs, at least. The partnership between the state government and IBs could lead to the offered qardhul hassan financing-sourced funding from waqf for reduced financial hardships by needy and poor folks.

Scholars have explored Ottoman strategies for managing agricultural and extractive landscapes, yet detailed investigation of socio-political responses to dynamic wetlands, particularly during periods of drastic climate shifts, requires deeper investigation. Our research on wetlands and lakes moves from the purview of waqfs (pious foundations) to the emergence of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA). By examining the shifting perspectives of institutional authority and community responses to it from the early modern period to the nineteenth century, we discuss the complexities of wetland management in the Marmara Lake Basin within the sancak of Saruhan (contemporary Manisa) in western Anatolia. We argue that intimate knowledge of this specific ecosystem played a critical role in mitigating attempts at reclamation and land grabbing and ultimately in developing legal structures of and policies for Ottoman conservation strategies. We situate our discussion within the paradigm of environing made possible by detailed longue-durée archival narratives; these micro-histories afford a dynamic perspective into non-linear responses to ecological and political changes and provide a local lens into the scalar impacts of human agency. © 2024 White Horse Press.

We applied the quantile-on-quantile (QARDL) approach from 1990 to 2019. Our findings indicate that GE consumption mitigates CO2 emissions by increasing economic growth in different quantiles in the USA. Furthermore, Eco-innovations also contribute to economic growth by reducing CO2 emissions in different quantiles. Additionally, Bi-directional quantile causality was found between green energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions. Thus, the empirical results of the current study provide acumens for policymakers of the USA to consume green energy and use green technology and environmental innovations to counterbalance the environmental issues induced by CO2 emissions without halting economic growth and sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {China has seen an increasing level of influence in the world economy. The economic success of the country has been phenomenal over the years. One of the biggest costs of economic growth in China has been the substantial rise in emission levels. China is one of the largest polluters in the world. The country is also facing the wrath of the worsening environmental crisis, with one region facing extreme flooding while another region is suffering from drought. Due to these chaotic environmental conditions, the agriculture industry has suffered hard, and there are increasing concerns over the food security of the country. This study focused on identifying the relationship between Fintech (FNT), Natural Resources (NTR) and usage of Energy (ENR) on Environmental Sustainability (ENS) using the “Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag” (QARDL) approach in China. The findings of the study suggest that the use of FNT can promote green finance and help promote the green growth of an economy. The increased use of NTR can have a detrimental impact on the ENS, and China must reduce the use of NTR in their operations. Furthermore, ENR is often considered the root cause of environmental problems in a country like China. The recommendation of the study includes moving away from fossil fuels through the use of renewable energy. The transition can be facilitated using carbon tax and environmental subsidies. The government must adopt the principles of a sustainable supply chain to get the best results for the future as far as ENS is concerned. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Achieving carbon neutrality is essential for environmental sustainability and should be pursued with minimal disruption to economic growth. China's recent commitment to carbon neutrality holds significant importance in current discussions. This study investigates strategies to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs), emphasizing carbon neutrality. It also examines the long-term impacts and causality between fiscal decentralization and institutional quality in relation to carbon dioxide (CO2). emissions Utilizing the quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) approach and the Granger causality in quantiles, our findings reveal a statistically negative ECM parameter across all quantiles. This indicates a stable, long-term relationship between fiscal decentralization (FDC), institutional quality (INSQ), and CO2 emissions. The study verifies the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in China across different quantiles. In the long run, fiscal decentralization seems to increase CO2 emissions, but robust institutional quality mitigates this impact. The Granger causality results highlight the intricate relationships among the variables. This research emphasizes the need for policymakers to bolster environmental protection and efficiency, ensuring fiscal decentralization benefits both environmental and economic agendas. © 2024},

	abstract = {Cash waqf is a form of contemporary waqf that has great potential in the modern world. In Indonesia, despite its potential of 180 trillion per year, cash waqf collection, management, and distribution are not optimal. Nonetheless, the infrastructure sector in Indonesia faces obstacles, particularly in terms of funding. The innovation of the CWLFRA (Cash Waqf Linked DINFRA) model is, therefore, a solution to these two issues, as the proposed model is the result of an integration between efforts to optimize cash waqf and infrastructure financing via the Infrastructure Investment Fund (DINFRA). In this CWLFRA innovation, waqf funds will be allocated to the mauquf 'alaih from the profits of infrastructure investment funds, which will become a source of long-term usable assets. As a result, the purpose of this academic paper is to develop a model capable of bolstering the ecosystem of Islamic social financial institutions and maximizing the potential achievement of cash waqf in Indonesia as a means of implementing sustainable finance and an effective instrument in reviving national economy through infrastructure development. In addition, this study seeks to determine the viability of the potential for developing the productivity of cash waqf in an effort to increase the effectiveness of achieving cash waqf to support economic sustainability with infrastructure potential. Nine respondents representing academicians and expert practitioners from both the waqf and infrastructure sectors filled out questionnaires to collect data. According to the results of the Delphi test, all respondents believed that there was a relationship between the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) indicators, indicating that this model is implementable. Moreover, based on the level of agreement of respondents, this model has the potential to contribute positively to national economic recovery, become a sustainable source of social funds, optimize the potential of waqf in Indonesia, strengthen the ecosystem of waqf social finance institutions, and improve the quality of management and maintenance of Indonesia's infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that integrating financial waqf with existing public infrastructure could positively affect the sustainability of national economic development. The novel aspect of this paper is the proposed cash waqf management system, which can serve as a useful reference for policymakers and waqf institutions seeking to develop a more effective waqf concept in terms of collection, administration, and distribution. Consequently, this study aims to demonstrate the potential for cash waqf, which can be integrated with DINFRA's product through the innovation of the CWL-FRA model, to become an investment instrument and offer a diversity of options to the waqf community. © The Author(s) (2023).},

	abstract = {This study employs a basic qualitative approach, analyzing two case studies in which the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) is the sole trustee of legitimate state waqf assets. Is there a significant difference in the management of these two waqf hotels, as far as the organization that manages them? This study also explores the connection between waqf principles and hotel management, with a particular emphasis on the distribution of waqf benefits generated by the waqf hotel business. The goal is to investigate different perspectives on decision-making, challenges, and achievements in the sector. A semi-structured interview was conducted with two representatives from SIRC and one from Yayasan Wakaf Malaysia (YWM), both of whom manage waqf hotels. This research is guided by the principles of Fiqh Al-Awlawiyyat, which provides a thorough understanding of Islamic legal principles governing waqf and contemporary hotel management. Two waqf hotels have been chosen for a review of the management style and ownership structure using the criteria that have been established. Interview data was thematically analyzed to identify recurring patterns and gain valuable insights. Preliminary findings demonstrate the importance of community support for this waqf hotel to optimize profits. Muslims bear a great deal of responsibility if they understand that the money, they spend to stay at this waqf hotel is for the benefit of third parties in need of assistance. This study makes practical recommendations for improving the sustainability and effectiveness of waqf hotels; ongoing promotion and awareness should be prioritized. Muslims must understand that choosing a waqf hotel is a responsibility, not an option.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Zakat can be allocated to help the poor establish a sustainable income. Recipients may receive zakat assistance in the form of both capital and job equipment, coupled with suitable training. Traditionally, zakat distribution has adhered to classical principles, involving monthly financial aid or limited working capital. However, this method is perceived as less effective in eradicating poverty. This study emphasises the significance of directing zakat towards income generation as a more impactful approach to poverty alleviation. To this end, this study explores classical and modern models of zakat disbursements for income generation, drawing from scholars’ perspectives in their respective eras. A qualitative approach for data collection and analysis was adopted based on the evidence from classical and modern literature. There are several methods of zakat disbursement for income generation, namely capital grants, loans, and training. Based on a survey of classical and modern literature, it was found that some classical scholars have granted such disbursements. Recognising the efficacy of this approach in helping zakat recipients, modern scholars are inclined to support income generation programs, including zakat loan provision. The evolution of this concept, coupled with its successful implementation, positions zakat as a key player in eradicating poverty among Muslims globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose — This research examines cash waqf-linked ṣukūk (CWLS) and ascertains its viability in Malaysia under the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks of waqf (Islamic endowment) and ṣukūk (Islamic investment securities). This is explored with a view to a possible implementation of CWLS in Malaysia by Islamic social and commercial finance institutions. Design/Methodology/Approach — The research adopts a qualitative methodology and uses content analysis in synthesising relevant data to determine the viability and prospects of CWLS in Malaysia. Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted, and data obtained therefrom was analysed alongside published literature on CWLS to identify issues in the applicable waqf and ṣukūk legal and regulatory frameworks that pertain to CWLS viability. Findings — The combination of cash waqf with ṣukūk is potentially an impactful financing mechanism for mobilising funds whereby charity is linked with productive and income-generating economic activities. CWLS facilitates the development of alternative social financing instruments that expedite social welfare and economic revival in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Indonesia demonstrates. However, Malaysia’s waqf legal and regulatory framework have established a decentralised system of waqf administration, which may impede the efficacy of the structure and operations of CWLS in the country. Hence the research proposes a reform of the framework to enable the establishment of a more capable and viable CWLS structure for digital, retail and institutional investors. Originality/Value — This research discovers hindrances to the prospect of CWLS in the legal, Sharīʿah and regulatory dynamics of waqf and ṣukūk in Malaysia that previous studies overlooked. This research provides an in-depth understanding of challenges to CWLS’ implementation in Malaysia with invaluable insight for regulators, policymakers, practitioners and researchers, thereby contributing to practical knowledge in the area. © Sherin Kunhibava, Aishath Muneeza, Zakariya Mustapha, Maryam Khalid and Thong Ming Sen.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy not only helps to safeguard the environment and slow down climate change but also supports economic growth and energy security. The significance of renewable energy sources is expanding as more people throughout the globe understand how important it is to switch to clean energy sources. Therefore, empirics are in search of the factors that can promote renewable energy production. This analysis investigates some of the novel determinants of renewable energy production, such as digital inclusion, public participation, and environmental governance, which have not been examined previously in any study. For empirical analysis, the study employs the ARDL and QARDL estimation techniques using Chinese data from 1998Q1 to 2021Q4. The analysis findings confirm that digital financial inclusion, ICT, and GDP are vital in boosting both short and long-run renewable production. Green investment, environmental governance, and carbon emissions also significantly and favourably impact long-run renewable energy production. In the Quantile ARDL model, digital financial inclusion is positively linked to renewable energy production at most of its quantiles in the short and long run, while the ICT, GDP, environmental governance, and carbon emissions are positively linked to renewable energy in most quantiles in the long-run only. The Wald test confirms the asymmetric impact for all variables in the long run, which implies that policymakers should consider the positive and negative changes in these factors while devising policies for enhancing renewable energy production. © 2023.

Findings: The outcome of this study reveals some untouched areas that needed immediate attention where GS can be implemented. This study recommends implementing GS for the plant, agriculture, forests, road, water, animal and others. One example in this regard is to create “forest sukuk,” which is a tool for financing forest preservation.

	abstract = {The global issue of atmospheric variations and global warming caused by diverse anthropogenic behaviors is a global concern. There is apprehension about preserving an uncontaminated atmosphere and attaining optimal nuclear and geothermal energy utilization with agriculture sector development. In this regard, this paper investigates the influence of nuclear energy, geothermal energy, agriculture development, and urbanization on carbon emissions and ecological footprint from 1990Q1 to 2019Q4 in the case of China. The findings of unit root tests reveal that all variables are stationary at first integration order, and cointegration test findings confirm the presence of long-run relationships among series. The quantile autoregressive distributive lag (QARDL) method findings demonstrate that nuclear energy, geothermal energy, and urbanization statistically correlate with CO2 emissions and ecological footprint across all quantiles, indicating that these determinants have contributed to environmental degradation. Whereas agricultural development has a statistically significant and negative influence on the environment, implying that agriculture has a pollution-mitigation impact. Based on these empirical findings, several policy implications are presented to preserve environmental quality to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research},

Design/methodology/approach: In the Malaysian context the authors use generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the mitigating effect of CG structure and CS disclosures on distance to default (DD) of sukuk issuers. Findings: The results show that although both CG and CS have a significant and positive relationship with distance to default, the contribution of CS to augment DD is higher. Moreover, different CG variables have a varied relationship with distance to default, while the association is positive for all three pillars of CS, videlicet economic, social and environmental sustainability. Practical implications: The findings of the study hold important implications for issuers, subscribers and regulators in the sukuk industry. Originality/value: Limited research investigates the relationship between CG, CS and default risk of Islamic bonds. In light of this, the study attempts to fill the theoretical void in literature by examining the relationship among the underlying variables. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Agricultural water resource utilization efficiency in China is facing significant challenges due to the dual constraints of carbon emissions and water pollution. The inefficiency in water usage in agriculture not only impacts the sustainability of water resources but also contributes to environmental degradation through increased carbon emissions and water pollution. Agricultural water resource utilization efficiency under the constraint of carbon emission and water pollution has been a critical issue in China from 2005 to 2022. This study employs the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method to comprehensively assess and analyze the complex relationship that exists between agricultural water usage, carbon emissions, and water pollution. By analyzing distinct quantiles of the data distribution, the research investigates how different levels of water resource utilization efficiency relate to carbon emissions and water pollution under various conditions. The findings reveal nuanced insights into the dynamic interactions among these components within the agricultural sector. This research project focuses on the efficiency of water resource utilization in agriculture while considering the constraints of carbon emission and water pollution. Given the dynamic and time-dependent character of these components, the QARDL methodology makes it possible to get a detailed knowledge of how they interact within the framework of agriculture. The study aims to give significant insights and policy suggestions to improve agricultural practices while minimizing environmental concerns linked to carbon emissions and water pollution. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Natural resources play a pivotal role in the global economy, with numerous nations leveraging their extraction, utilization, and exportation as primary drivers for economic advancement. Nonetheless, an overreliance on these resources can expose countries to the adverse effects of climate change, including droughts, floods, and other extreme climatic events, thereby jeopardizing production and revenue streams. Paradoxically, the revenues derived from natural resource extraction can be channeled towards initiatives aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation, underscoring the intricate interplay between natural resources and climate vulnerability. This research endeavors to elucidate the inverted U-shaped relationship between total natural resources rent and climate vulnerability. The study encompasses nineteen resource-rich countries over the period 2000–2021. Employing the panel quantile ARDL (Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag) methodology with a dynamic fixed effect specification, we delve into the moderating influence of overall productive capacity, trade openness and urbanization on the nexus between resource extraction and climate vulnerability. The panel QARDL estimations are segmented into the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles for both long-term and short-term outcomes. In the long-term perspective, our findings validate an inverted U-shaped association between total natural resources rent and climate vulnerability. Factors such as urbanization and trade openness exhibit a positive correlation with climate vulnerability, whereas economic growth demonstrates an inverse relationship. Significantly, the study reveals that productive capacity, when acting as a moderator for natural resources rent, holds the potential to attenuate climate vulnerability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

As a result, there is a need for sustainable and environmentally-friendly growth. However, the concept of “pollution havens” is becoming increasingly relevant, with businesses relocating to developing countries in search of more lax environmental regulations. This could lead to higher-than-desirable rates of pollution and environmental damage. To address this issue, this study assesses the role of natural resources (NTR), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Financial Development (FDT), and Green Finance (GFN) using QARDL analysis. The study found that NTR, FDI, and FDT increased CO2 emissions, while GFN reduced them in the short and long run. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, who can use the information to develop policies that promote economic growth while reducing environmental pollution. Additionally, the study highlights the need to prevent businesses from exploiting lax environmental regulations in developing countries. Overall, the findings of this study underscore the importance of balancing economic development and environmental sustainability and call for the prioritization of green initiatives in policy development. © 2023},

	abstract = {Most People’s Religious Schools (Sekolah Agama Rakyat-SAR) face financial constraints in managing and administering schools. Therefore, SAR administrators strive to obtain funds through instruments such as waqf, for example, cash waqf. However, until now, the implementation of cash waqf instruments in SAR has not received much attention among SAR administrators. Nevertheless, Sekolah Rendah Islam Tahfiz Integrasi Al-Fateh, Raub, Pahang (SRITI, Al-Fateh) is one of the SARs that has implemented cash waqf and has had a positive impact on the school’s development. The objective of this study is to identify the method of implementing cash waqf and to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation in sustaining the finances of Al-Fateh Integrated Tahfiz Islamic Primary School (SRITI), Raub, Pahang, Malaysia. This is a qualitative study. A face-to-face interview was carried out as a data collection method using semi-structured questions involving three respondents comprising the chairperson, a local officer, and a project manager of SRITI Al-Fateh. The study data was supported by secondary sources such as books, magazines, journals, articles, and others. The data obtained was analyzed using the content analysis method. The study outcome finds that SRITI Al-Fateh has collected waqf in the form of cash. The funds collected came from various groups of the society such as individuals and NGOs. From the funds, a two-story school building was successfully constructed, and a mosque (still being constructed), and they serve as an activity center for teachers and students. This study hopes that the method of implementation of cash waqf by SRITI Al-Fateh can serve as guidance for SAR in Malaysia and other educational institutions in the effort to sustain the school finances. Future work can be done by making comparisons with one or more other SARs to show the effectiveness of cash waqf implementation. © (2024), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although green Sukuk (GS) as a sustainability enabler has started to emerge globally, a limited amount of research has focused on understanding its perspectives and potential. Accordingly, this research aims to explore the economic, social, and financial perspectives of GS by conceptualizing the effects of the issuance of green Sukuk (IGS) on economic growth (EG), social development (SD), and financial performance (FP). The fundamentals of the resource-based view (RBV) theory and institutional theory are employed to develop the theoretical underpinnings of this research. The panel data for IGS, EG, SD, and FP indicators between 2018 and 2021 were collected from Indonesia and were analyzed using the generalized method of movements regression technique. The results indicate that IGS positively interacts with all three indicators (EG, SD, and FP). Further analysis reveals that IGS has a moderate positive effect on EG, a weak positive effect on SD, and a significant positive effect on FP. Our research findings contribute to developing an integrated business landscape covering major domains of environmental sustainability, socioeconomic development, and financial performance under the GS theme. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

It combines Islamic principles with environmental conservation, as being waqf assets, a forest is prohibited from being sold, given, or inherited. An effective management strategy is crucial to ensure waqf-based forest productivity and sustainability. Some research has already been conducted, but the specific dimension remains unexplored. This study aims to identify essential aspects and effective management strategies to escalate waqf-based forest benefits. Using a comprehensive approach, this study combines a literature study, in-depth interviews, and a study case in Bogor Waqf Forest, Bogor Regency, Indonesia. The findings were analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and further in-depth interviews as the validation process. There are six important considerations to optimize waqf-based forest management: legal, ecological, Islamic, economical, social, and aesthetic. The land’s legal status as waqf assets is recognized as the most crucial aspect to avoid possible conflict and sustainability in the future. Then, the following considerations are improved ecological and Islamic activities aspects, economic strategies, and social and aesthetic consecutively. This research is expected to provide a deeper investigation of the future management strategies for waqf-based forests. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Promoting environmental sustainability has become a global imperative in our collective efforts to combat climate change. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore effective strategies for achieving environmental sustainability. In this context, we investigate the nexus between sustainable tourism, renewable energy, technological innovation, and environmental quality. Our study utilizes panel data from the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries, covering the period from 1995 to 2020, and categorizes the sample into distinct income clusters. Employing rigorous empirical methods such as panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL), panel unit root tests, ordinary least squares (OLS), and the Wald test, we uncover significant insights. Notably, our findings reveal that sustainable tourism and technological innovation exhibit robust negative long-run associations with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across all economic groups. Furthermore, renewable energy demonstrates a significantly negative long-run relationship with GHG emissions in low-income economies (specifically, 0.8%, 1.2%, and 1.2% at the 50th, 70th, and 90th quantiles, respectively). The comprehensive analysis, encompassing the entire sample, underscores the significantly negative link between sustainable tourism, technological innovation, and GHG emissions in both the long-run and short-run. Additionally, our Wald test results validate the dynamic integration and parameter consistency over time. In light of these findings, we advocate that all stakeholders in BRI economies embrace environmentally conscious growth strategies and innovative technologies to achieve lasting environmental sustainability. © 2024 The Authors},

This study investigates the impact of terrorism and military expenditure on environmental sustainability in 35 economies in SSA from 1990 to 2021, utilizing panel quantile autoregressive distributed lag regression and causality analysis techniques to bridge the gap in existing studies on the military expenditure, environmental sustainability, and terrorism nexus. The study's novelty is evident because it assesses the short-term and long-term impacts of military expenditure and other covariates across various quantiles of CO2 emissions. The study achieves this by categorizing SSA nations based on their varying levels of CO2 emissions, specifically low, moderate, and high, an approach that is extremely rare among SSA countries. The study's findings revealed that terrorism and military expenditure have a positive impact on CO2 emissions across the quantiles, implying that these variables contribute to environmental degradation in the region. The study also reveals a bidirectional relationship between CO2 emissions and the selected predictors (terrorism, military expenditure, trade, and economic growth). Thus, the study proposes military strategies and macroeconomic policies that ensure environmental sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Despite its pledge and efforts towards sustainability, China has not been able to live up to its environmental expectations. The road towards carbon neutrality still seems to be faraway. There has been light at the end of the tunnel with the various efforts China has undertaken to reduce environmental pollution (ENP). However, such efforts are not enough and the country must adopt some strategies which can be used to curb environmental pollution and promote more sustainable growth for the country in the long run. Hence, this study assess the role of Fintech (FNT), Natural resources (NTR), and government effectiveness (GVT) on environmental pollution. For that purpose, the study uses the novel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method, which assist in examining the impact of modelled series in multiple quantiles. The findings of the study suggest that Fintech can help to promote the use of digitalization within the financial industry and can be an efficient way to reduce CO2 emissions. Green finance and green investments can also be promoted using FinTech. The use and extraction of Natural resources are detrimental to the environment. Lack of government effectiveness can lead to severe environmental problems in the form of lax laws and corruption. The study recommends China promote the use of green energy, nurture the growth of Fintech and ensure that it works to develop a green image of the government to facilitate the growth of a green economy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Thermal Humidity Index (THI) and season effect on productive traits (LTMY, TMY, LP and DP) were varied from significant (P<0.05) to highly significant (P<0.01) for both groups, except for the effect of THI on the DMY in P2 and season effect on DMY in P1, which were non-significant. Climate change in the period from 2011 to 2022 witnessed a rise in atmospheric temperature (AT), which was followed by an increase in relative humidity (RH) and atmospheric pressure (AP), as well as an increase in the value of THI especially in the summer season, which is hotter than the rest of the seasons, this had a negative effect on the productive traits. Estimates of permanent environmental variance for the second period for most traits were lower than additive genetic variance, it may indicate that sensitivity to heat stress is not specific to the cow but is hereditary.

	abstract = {The climate crisis is increasing fast to leave an everlasting impact on China and its operations. China faces the prospect of one region facing extreme flooding while another region grapples with scorching heat and drought. There has been a substantial rise in typhoons and storms. The food security of the nation has taken a hit, and the country has seen its rice production fall by about 8%. This issue is concerning for not only China but the whole world, as a huge number of countries depend on China for food supplies. This research studied the role of Fintech, Natural Resources and Urbanization on environmental sustainability in China by considering the data from 2000 to 2020, using the sophisticated and resilient Qunatile-based ARDL approach. The findings suggest that the use of Fintech can help to achieve green growth while the use of Natural resources can have a detrimental impact on environmental sustainability. Similarly, urbanization leads to increased human activity, which would increase the level of CO2 emissions and result in deforestation, which deteriorates the ecological balance of a country. China is recommended to introduce a carbon tax to ensure that firms find it costly to use unsustainable sources of energy. The funds raised from carbon taxes can be used to finance green projects. Fintech can be used to facilitate the green economy by allowing green loans and green finances to ensure green growth in China. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Belt and Road Initiative countries working on the One Belt and One Road project (OBOR), constituting 130 countries, are participating with China to achieve growth via trade. These countries, where trade and commerce have influence, are rich in natural minerals as well as natural habitat and biodiversity. Along with infrastructural efforts, the world is also experiencing a growth in technology 4.0, specifically its gains in terms of financial innovation. This study has explored 27 countries from the Asian OBOR group and assessed the potential moderating role of FinTech on resource extraction sustainability. The results from multi-dimensional, long-term, and robust estimates showed that resource rents harm environmental performance and FinTech positively moderates this relationship.

The secondary data has been gathered using a secondary source like World Bank from 1991 to 2020. The Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) was employed by the study to examine the linkage among variables, while the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test was adopted to check the stationarity. The results revealed that electricity production from oil, coal and nuclear has a positive connection with CO2 emission. The findings also exposed that the FFEC, energy import, and energy use also have a positive linkage with CO2 emission.

	abstract = {The use of structured query formulation languages is a method for gaining access to data in information management systems. Writing structured queries is a powerful method of data retrieval, and end users can generate complex database queries by becoming proficient in a particular query language. Digitization of database information systems, history and endowment, and technology conservation are some examples of database conservation techniques in the process of displaying data that require optimal query techniques. Historical and endowment properties comply with a certain set of laws governing waqf recipients, which sets them apart from heritage and cultural assets. Trusted property typically comprises real estate, valuables, or both and has an infinite preservation term so long as it may still be put to use. A solid information technology infrastructure is essential for ensuring comprehensive data security. Given the availability of knowledge and the quick development of information technology, ensuring its sustainability is a challenge. This research is aimed at preserving historical and waqf databases based on the case study of the Kingdom of Sumedang Larang (KSL), Indonesia, through examination of the database, synchronization of digital data with physical data, as well as looking at its relationship with organizations and management. The proposed method, namely the Design and Analysis of Database Query Model for Preservation Information System (DAQMP), creates a recurring query model from the original tabular data placed in the next table as a special table check for data specifications containing important data. The results must be accurately aligned between digital and physical records regularly to serve as a record of any changes and as evidence to determine whether data has been corrupted, altered, or lost. © 2023 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: A series of interviews with four waqf officers who are involved with waqf reporting process from four different waqf institutions in Malaysia were conducted. Findings: The findings show a number of reasons for the current weak waqf reporting practices including the absence of standardised waqf reporting standards, no reporting or disclosure awareness by the waqf management, limited reporting channels from the state authorities to the national authorities, diversification in the governance structure and reluctance of waqf administration to disclose waqf reporting. The findings also identified several factors contributing to good waqf reporting practices. This includes leadership, good cultural setting within the institution, political will as a push factor, limited qualified personnel as well as sustainability issues and finally, the visibility of the waqf report itself. Practical implications: The study findings and recommendations are useful for the State Islamic Religious Councils and waqf institutions in Malaysia to enhance the waqf reporting practices in Malaysia.

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite being a Muslim-dominated country, Bangladesh has widely embraced traditional microfinance since its inception in the mid-1970s. However, Islamic microfinance, which has a lot to offer to the poor, is still in its infancy and has yet to gain momentum in the country. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the importance of Islamic microfinance and propose alternative Shariah-compliant microfinance models in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on the desk research method, which relies on existing literature to collect secondary data on key concerns of traditional microfinance programs. In addition, institutional-level secondary data were also collected from the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) of Bangladesh. Guided by the Maqasid-al-Shariah, this study then proposes several Islamic microfinance models to overcome selected challenges faced by the microfinance industry in Bangladesh. Findings: This study suggested three composite Shariah-compliant microfinance models, which are likely to help the underprivileged and thus ensure the achievement of the sustainable development goals in Bangladesh. The first model explained how the operational strategy of incumbent microfinance institutions (MFIs) could be restructured, while the second proposed the organizational strategies for establishing a new MFI. The third model used the notion of Sadaqah (charity) to address the multiple borrowing issues of the industry. Meanwhile, the successful transformation of the conventional microfinance industry to an Islamic one is dependent on the effective collaboration between the regulatory authorities, practitioners and MFIs. Originality/value: Albeit the paucity of literature on the topic, the findings of this study will guide policymakers/practitioners in designing relevant microfinance models to help transform conventional microfinance into Islamic microfinance in Bangladesh. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To calculate the short- and long-term relationships between REC, TPU, national income, carbon footprints, and financial development, we used the nonlinear QARDL technique. The estimates reveal that an upsurge in TPU hurts REC in the short and long run. Conversely, a stable trade policy or a reduction in TPU increases REC in the long run. In the short run, a fall in TPU exerts no influence on REC. The findings further imply that various factors, including GDP, CO2 emissions, and financial development, contribute to long-term improvements in REC in China, both in the short and long run. © 2024},

	abstract = {In the modern world, emerging economies are examining how technological progression and carbon neutrality goals can encourage sustainable production and consumption. Striving for carbon neutrality requires using energy storage technologies and alternative energy sources. This study investigates Indonesia’s ecological sustainability, focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and air quality index-related smog pollution, with renewable energy adoption, energy storage technology, and environmental innovation as primary influencing factors. The study employed the Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) method to explore long-term and short-term correlations between the predictors and the resultant variables. The study’s findings reveal a significant negative correlation between adopting renewable energy (REA), using renewable energy and energy storage technology (EST) and CO2 emissions across various quantiles in Indonesia. However, globalization was found to have a positive and significant relationship with CO2 emissions, but this association was only seen at higher quantiles. The long-term analysis revealed that environmental conservation efforts, renewable energy utilization, and environmental taxes could significantly reduce PM2.5 level haze pollution in Indonesia. The QARDL method also supports a negative long-term correlation between REA, alternative ALT, and EST, while globalization is linked to increased CO2 emissions in Indonesia, exacerbating environmental sustainability concerns. In summary, this research concludes that practical innovation, renewable energy consumption, and environmental taxation decrease carbon emissions, while globalization increases them in Indonesia. © 2024, Econjournals.

	abstract = {Purpose: SRI Sukuk, with its outcome-based emphasis, aims to align the Islamic finance industry with its original ideals and address criticisms related to form over substance. In Malaysia, while the pioneering Sukuk Ihsan was a “social” sukuk, recent SRI Sukuk issuances have predominantly been “green” or “sustainable” sukuk. This paper aims to evaluate the Malaysian SRI Sukuk market, identifying factors favouring “green” sukuk. It also examines whether structural issues in Sukuk Ihsan deterred subsequent issuers from “social” sukuk. The emergence of SRI Sukuk responds to sustainable development goals and the shift towards a low-carbon economy. Sukuk Ihsan, as the first Shariah-compliant pay-for-success structure, poses complexity and risk management challenges to meet performance criteria. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative method in the form of a critical review of literature, interview sessions with experts and stakeholders who are familiar with SRI Sukuk and Sukuk Ihsan and a case study analysis of Sukuk Ihsan. Findings: The popularity of “green” sukuk reflects the growing global environmental consciousness. The main factors driving the popularity of “green” sukuk are the maturity of the market and the existence of a strong supporting infrastructure for “green” issuances while the positive profiling benefits and availability of incentives for “green” issuances also contribute to a lesser extent. The recommendations include the promotion of “social” sukuk by regulators through a focus on establishing a similar supporting infrastructure for “social” sukuk as there are for SRI and standard Sukuk. In addition, issuers of “social” sukuk may want to reconsider the inclusion of key performance indicators (“KPI”) into the structure of future “social” sukuk issuances. Research limitations/implications: Although all respondents considered Sukuk Ihsan to be a success, some potential areas of improvement were also noted. These include the structuring of future “social” sukuk issuances with a bigger discount to compensate for the additional risk being assumed by the investor; the need to be more careful in the KPI selection process; and one respondent even went so far as to suggest the possibility of totally removing the step-down feature of Sukuk Ihsan. Practical implications: Industry implications of Sukuk Ihsan study include findings that require balancing disclosure and economics by providing additional disclosure requirements for SRI Sukuk that may pose risks without corresponding benefits for issuers. KPI selection and investor confidence should also be properly identified, as KPIs are essential for the pay-for-success model to work successfully. For sukuk holders, findings indicate that any approval for waivers during issuance can impact investor confidence negatively. Investor literacy and impact understanding should also be improved for social Sukuk success. Investors should understand the different risk exposures and evolving impact requirements vital for sustainable growth. Social implications: The findings provide significant implications for social impact Sukuk issuance. They include providing a substantial case study for future social impact issuances, based on the pioneering impact of Sukuk Ihsan. Furthermore, Sukuk Ihsan’s unqualified success validates the feasibility of socially responsible sukuk. Despite its early introduction, both tranches being fully subscribed reflects robust investor interest. Stakeholders were also proud of their involvement in such an initiative, viewing it as a significant achievement in creating societal impact. Originality/value: Although there have been several prior studies done on Sukuk Ihsan, the focus of those studies was on its structure and the novelty of its “step down” returns structure where investors would receive lower returns if certain key performance indicators (“KPIs”) are met by Yayasan AMIR in the execution of its Trust School Programme. Bearing in mind that the first Sukuk Ihsan has a June 2022 maturity date, and the results of its KPIs were announced in December 2021, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the only documented case study that comprehensively reviews Sukuk Ihsan and identifies lessons learned and/or opportunities for improvement for the benefit of potential SRI Sukuk issuers in the future. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The agriculture sector, being highly vulnerable to climate change, plays a pivotal role in achieving green and sustainable economies. As the 2030 Agenda emphasizes the integrated development of environmental, social, and economic dimensions, it is crucial to understand how agricultural practices affect sustainability. This study investigates the environmental impact of the agricultural sector on the green economy by examining key environmental factors, such as agricultural energy emissions, environmental taxes, irrigated water use efficiency, fertilizer use, and pesticide application. The analysis is conducted using the Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model, with robustness checks performed through the comparison with the Panel ARDL model, using data from 2000 to 2020. To assess the green economy, an index is constructed based on 20 indicators related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The results show that agricultural energy emissions, despite their environmental cost, are positively associated with green economy development, highlighting the trade-off between high productivity and environmental degradation in a resource-efficient economy. Improved water use efficiency is found to enhance agricultural sustainability and production. Additionally, environmental taxes and regulations exert a significant positive effect on both environmental preservation and social welfare. Contrary to the belief that reducing agricultural production will lower carbon emissions, the study suggests that adopting environmentally friendly practices and imposing targeted taxes are more effective strategies. The findings also reveal a negative relationship between excessive fertilizer use and the green economy, indicating the need for minimal fertilizer application to promote sustainability. The study concludes with specific policy recommendations. Governments, particularly in countries that have not yet adopted sustainable agricultural practices, should implement environmental taxes and regulations to promote carbon neutrality and support the Sustainable Development Goals. These measures are essential to balancing economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity in the agricultural sector. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamic effect of external conflict risk on environmental transition by considering the impacts of eco-innovation, economic growth, and energy consumption in a panel comprising 26 European countries from 2011 to 2020. Using a non-parametric model represented by the panel QARDL, we find that in the short run, a 1% increase in external conflict risk statistically leads to a 0.25% and 0.13% increase in the likelihood of environmental transition for the median and extreme upper quantiles (50th and 95th percentiles), respectively. However, the same increase holds little importance when considering the lower quantile (5th percentile). The indicated effect substantially decreases in the long run, reaching zero across the different quantiles. We also note discrepancies in the impact of energy across various quantile levels. For instance, the effect of population is significant from the 5th to the 90th quintiles. Overall, our findings suggest that enhancing eco-innovation helps reduce environmental transition risk. The results are relevant to the development of environmental policies and provide valuable insights for energy officials, technology stakeholders, and policymakers in their attempts to strengthen resilience during an environmental transition. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Economies around the globe are pushing toward a society's sustainability perspectives and upgradation in technology to protect the environment from global warming and the depletion of energy supplies. This shift in perception is primarily intended to alter people's attitudes toward posterity. By integrating the theories of interactions between social and ecological systems and the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) framework, this study explores the impact of nonrenewable energy consumption, social sustainability, and technological innovation on CO₂ emissions across the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 2001 through 2020. Based on the estimates of FMOLS, PARDL, and QARDL, the 10-year CO2 emissions and gross domestic product projections are traced using the average growth rate for each country and an average value of independent variables. The findings of this study highlight the detrimental effect of nonrenewable energy consumption on CO₂ emissions, underscoring the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. However, the positive role of social sustainability and technological innovation in curbing CO₂ emissions within OECD countries is equally significant. Accentuating the importance of social sustainability within this context, the study sheds light on the integral role that societal factors, such as education, public awareness, and social well-being, play a substantial role in shaping sustainable practices. It is found that Brazil, China, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, and Thailand need to focus on higher economic growth to experience decarbonizing economic growth. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the potential of Islamic climate finance in Indonesia and to map Islamic climate finance based on Islamic finance instruments, both commercial and social. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, between October 2022 and June 2023. This study adopted a qualitative interpretive approach in two phases. The first phase was desk-based research which focused on document analysis such as official documents, scientific publications, non-governmental organization publications and company reports in Indonesia. This analysis was conducted to identify significant milestones in developing green and eco-friendly finance that used Islamic financial instruments in Indonesia. The second phase consisted of interviews with essential Islamic climate finance project actors, such as green sukuk publishers, zakat and waqf collection agencies, stakeholders, capital market regulators, Shariah supervisory boards and Islamic finance experts. Findings: The main finding of this study is that the development of Islamic green finance in Indonesia can occur through various channels, including greening Islamic capital markets, greening Islamic social finance, Islamic green finance and developing green banking services for the unbanked to support financial inclusion. Green sukuk, or Islamic bonds, are key financial instruments in Islamic green finance. They are used to fund projects in areas such as clean energy, mass transit, water conservation, forestry and low-carbon technology. These green financing initiatives also include socially responsible investments that are designed to improve the lives of people and communities. Research limitations/implications: First, the availability of data on Islamic green finance practices in Indonesia may be limited, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape. Second, cultural and religious factors may play a role in the adoption and implementation of Islamic green finance, and these factors may vary across different regions in Indonesia. Practical implications: The exploration and clustering of Islamic climate finance based on Islamic financial instruments in Indonesia can lead to the development of more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the financial industry. Originality/value: This study serves as a pioneering effort to explore the potential and clustering of Islamic climate finance based on Islamic financial instruments in Indonesia. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},
