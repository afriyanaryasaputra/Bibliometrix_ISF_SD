	abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to identify some well-set instruments in Islam that can efficiently alleviate poverty, solve social problems and reduce social inequality through a new operational framework called "Islamic social business (ISB)". Design/methodology/approach-This is a conceptual research that is based on Al-Quranic principles as well as contemporary social welfare philosophies, such as, augmented stakeholder theory, social enterprise and social business. Al-Quran, Al-Hadith and existing traditional and Islamic literature are consulted for this study. Findings-The study proposes an efficient system of Islamic wealth sourcing and management to make the process of poverty alleviation sustainable. Other social problems for disadvantaged people, such as, health-, shelter-, literacy-and environmental-related issues are also addressed in the proposed system. The study identifies the inefficiency in the current practices and makes some propositions that are in conformance with Islamic principles and implementable by Islamic institutions all over the world. The authors propose a theoretical framework and operational propositions for ISB. Practical implications-In following this study, social policymakers, Islamic financial institutions, Islamic social enterprises and Islamic charity organizations will find organized guidelines to initiate "new entities" or "reshape existing entities". Social implications-The study will be effective in solving social problems, alleviating poverty and reducing social inequality. Originality/value-This is the first study that identifies all the potential Islamic sources of funding and the efficient management thereof through ISB. The study also proposes an ISB model and makes several propositions for different types of ISB. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Background - The success of Waqf as a source of socio-economic financing in Islamic history in developing a country by providing the social and public goods to the society have been a major factor for Waqf practices to be retrieved back today. In order to exterminate the poverty, depending in Zakat alone is not enough. Waqf can be an alternative in solving the socio-economic problem of the Ummah which covers the issues such as poverty, inequality and rising cost of living as well in promoting the social wellbeing in the society. Purpose - The purpose of this article is to analyze the related literatures on Waqf for poverty alleviation and social well-being between 2006 until 2016. Research Methodology - The methodology of this article is through descriptive research based on document analysis on previous articles and literatures on Waqf between 2006 until 2016. From 365 citation found under 'Waqf' keywords which including journal articles, books and conference paper, only 289 articles that are published under journals publications consists of national and international journals were selected and had been analyzed using the Statistical Product & Service Solution (SPSS) software. This study analyzed the articles selected by looking at several variables which including the year of publication, number of authors that contributes in the publish articles, the subject area of articles, the country that study Waqf research and the type of research method associated with the use of qualitative, quantitative and mixed method that used by the researcher. Findings - The general finding of this article shows that among the Waqf issues or subject that have the highest interest among the researcher for the current 10 years are related to the issues of cash Waqf (19.4%), Waqf property (13.8%) and Waqf concept (12.5%). However issues that related to poverty and poverty alleviation (14 articles), microfinance (17 articles) and corporate Waqf (13 articles) have also gained a popularity among the researcher.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to achieve scale, efficiency and mitigate high monitoring costs, and explores the efficacy of micro equity finance at the enterprise level. The study compares the economic features of the proposed framework with interest-based debt finance. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a mathematical model to highlight the problem of agency costs including adverse selection and moral hazard. Findings: Debt finance requires frequent repayments and indebtedness for financial inclusion. Conversely, the Islamic equity modes of financing in their current baseline structure suffer from high agency costs. By using enterprise level finance and distinct entry criterion for availing Islamic debt-based and micro equity finance, Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFIs) can reach the right targets and effectively mitigate the problem of adverse selection and high monitoring costs. The study suggests a framework in which equity financing could be used to fund microenterprises that will employ poor people with related skills. Research limitations/implications: As the preferable modes of Islamic finance, i.e. Musharakah and Mudarabah, are not used by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs), empirical analysis of performance is not possible as they are rarely used. Practical implications: The study suggests a workable model that can use Islamic equity-based modes of financing to improve microfinance outreach and achieve scale. The use of equity financing will help the Islamic finance industry to move toward its egalitarian vision, and the practical implementation of the model will help in reducing poverty in the Muslim majority countries. Social implications: Muslim countries host half of global poverty, even though their share in global population is only one-fourth. Hence, there is need for solutions in achieving scale in poverty alleviation efforts. Originality/value: Using a mathematical model, the paper presents agency problems in Islamic microfinance and proposes a solution through distinct entry criterion and enterprise level micro equity finance. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, none of the Muslim NGOs are able to finance their projects themselves but rely on foreign financial assistance. On the other hand, Ghanaian Muslim scholars have argued for the need to develop zakāt, the locally collected obligatory alms, into a fully-fledged welfare system. At the moment, this is not the case. On the other hand, there exists a local tradition of mutual support and tributary relations in Ghana, which is at least by some Muslims identified as being as efficient in providing social welfare.

The target population of this study is the masakin (poor) and fuqara (hardcore poor) (Note 1) categories of the Kelantan Islamic Religious Department (MAIK) (Note 2) zakat recipients. Simple Random sampling procedure is applied to collect primary data related to zakat recipients from the poor and hardcore poor category of ten districts of Kelantan. The effects of zakat distribution on poverty are analyzed within the context of burden of poverty; specifically in terms of incidence, intensity and severity of poverty. These are examined using four major indices of poverty, which include the Headcount Index, Average Poverty Gap, Income Gap and Sen Index. Results revealed that zakat distribution reduces poverty incidence, reduces the extent of poverty and lessens the severity of poverty. Further, the current zakat distribution in Kelantan only gives a small effect on increasing the income of the poor. Hence, by locating the perfect amount of zakat distribution to eliminate poverty and to offer alternative zakat distribution model is the best way in reducing the income inequality and maximization of social welfare. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

Muslims are generally accustomed to giving away charity as sign of religious devotion and care of the poor and needy in society. Yet while the significance of giving is a common practice in Muslim societies, the understanding of its ethico-spiritual dimensions is not; and requires further research. This paper sheds light on the multifaceted nature of sadaqa and how it is perceived not only as a means of spiritual purification, but also as factor of building socio-economic sustainability. This research draws on Islamic literature pertaining to the concepts, norms and laws of sadaqa in Islam to provide a conceptual framework of analysis of charity and its respective practice in Islam and thus supplies researchers with the perspective necessary for further interpretation and analysis on Islamic philanthropy. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

	abstract = {The cash waqf (endowment) has come into prominence in recent years since many Malaysian state Islamic religious councils and the Federal government (through a foundation) began promoting cash waqf schemes. However, unlike the Ottoman form which spent its income―derived from simple money-lending and istighlÉl (purchase and lease-back) practices―on the provision of services to meet public needs or for alms-giving, the modern cash waqf invests in low return savings or is converted through the process of istibdÉl (substitution) into low-income generating assets. This conceptual paper discusses the application of certain venture capital strategies in both the investment and spending decisions of the cash waqf. In its investment decisions, the cash waqf might utilise some of the tools employed by venture capital firms for choosing its investments and for mitigating risks. In fact, there is also a possibility for the cash waqf to consider certain venture capital opportunities as an alternative asset class in which to invest a portion of its corpus. In its spending decisions, the cash waqf may choose its beneficiaries in much the same way as a venture capital firm would choose its investees; that is, by putting together a portfolio of non-profit organizations (NPOs) with proven track records for delivering social results and which are seeking to grow their organizations to achieve financial sustainability. This paper therefore proposes an Enterprise Waqf Fund (EWF) model that combines the cash waqf model with relevant concepts from venture capital to enhance the dynamism of cash waqf. Policy and legal reforms are also recommended at the end of the paper that would provide an enabling environment within which the Enterprise Waqf Fund can operate. © 2012, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Design/methodology/approach – The paper combined qualitative and quantitative date to validate the appropriateness of FBM, to tackling poverty issues in Nigeria. The first section presents a brief introduction on poverty issue in Nigeria. The second section outlines the theoretical and methological approaches adopted in the paper. The third section casts a cursory look at the conceptualisation of poverty in the literature. The fourth section explores povertyeradication efforts in Nigeria. The fifth section highlights the failure of previous poverty reduction strategies (PRS) in Nigeria. The sixth section presents a background to MDGs. The seventh section showcases application of Islamic economics models (faithbased model and business system model (BSM)) to MDGs. The eighth section is devoted to data projections, analysis and interpretation. The final section concludes with policy prescriptions. Findings – On the basis of projection which is hinged on Shari'ah assumptions (minimum zakatable wealth and 2.5 per cent Zakat rate), the paper shows that Zakat and Sadaqat collections from year 2009 to 2015 would amount to N357,038 billions and N31 billion, respectively. These funds would go a long way in helping to alleviate poverty and actualisation of MDGs in Nigeria. Practical implications – The faithbased poverty reduction strategy enriched by BSM as conceptualised in this study can be used to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (MDG 1), achieve universal primary education (MDG 2), promote gender equality and empower women (MDG 3), reduce child mortality (MDG 4), improve maternal health (MDG 5), combat, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDGs 6), ensure environmental sustainability (MDG 7) and develop a global partnership for development (MDG 8). Originality/value – The results of this paper support the Islamic economics view that Zakat and Sadaqat are viable fiscal mechanisms for poverty alleviation where adopted. The FBM as conceptualised in this paper would therefore complement and pose a positive challenge to contemporary PRS in use in many povertyridden nations where economic indicators have justified prevalence of poverty, despite the various PRS put in place by policy makers. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

We highlight the impact of an afterlife belief on economic aggregates and social welfare. These characteristics are incorporated into an overlapping generations model. An analysis is done in order to compare religious giving with other fiscal policies that have redistributive impact. Results show that when people have standard preferences, Zakat (a type of Islamic religious giving) although enhances redistribution, may not be the choice in terms of total welfare. But when people are risk adverse and have a belief in the existence of an afterlife, Zakat enhances both redistribution and total welfare due to a higher steady state capital.},

The paper estimates the resource required and potential zakat collection for poverty elimination. The paper employed the poverty gap index based on US $1.25 a day and US $2.0 a day estimated by the World Bank (2009). Zakat potential has been estimated by employing Kahf (1989) method of estimation with some modifications. The paper finds that half of the sample countries not only meet their resource shortfall by potential zakat collection but also generate surplus funds which are sufficient for the resource deficit countries. The paper suggests pooling of zakat funds from the zakat surplus countries and providing for the resource deficit countries to eliminate the poverty.},

Design/methodology/approach – The study formulates an index (BNDI) to measure the deficiency and effectiveness of zakat as one of the different items of government expenditure/spending to alleviate poverty. In this paper, Pakistan is chosen as a case study for two reasons: the availability and accessibility of data required for computing BNDI; and, in the past, no index such as this had been used to measure poverty in Pakistan. Findings – The results obtained from the computation of the BNDI have been able to explain the effectiveness of zakat in alleviating poverty and inequality in Pakistan. Practical implications – The findings of the study can be used by policymakers to measure and improve the effectiveness of zakat in reducing poverty and inequality. Social implications – As the ultimate beneficiaries of zakat are the poor people, the outcome of this study may help improve their quality of life. Originality/value – The paper develops a new methodology to measure poverty alleviation in Pakistan, focusing on the poor households’ consumption/expenditure on basic needs, government spending in terms of zakat and the number of zakat recipients as the three main determinants. The index developed in the present study can be applied to measure the performance of all Muslim countries whose provision of zakat is embedded in the national agenda to alleviate poverty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Using questionnaire survey on 184 zakat payers, this study shows that perceived board management influences zakat payers' trust on zakat institutions. By contrast, perceived governmental model does not influence zakat payers' trust on zakat institutions. These findings imply that zakat institutions should focus on strengthening the efficiency of their institutions to increase the trust level among zakat payers.

The paper draws upon theories of the development gift which focus upon the ethics and moralities of corporate giving and the ways in which development gifts extend capitalist power, re-embed morality in the market and bind recipients into hierarchical positions of unequal exchange. In contrast, we know significantly less about the moralities and motivations of the populations to whom the gifts are offered. Aiming to fill the lacunae, the paper shows how at Bibiyana the ‘community engagement’ programmes take place in a specific moral terrain which pre-dates the arrival of Chevron and has profoundly affected how their development goods are perceived, utilized and contested. Whilst Chevron's ‘community engagement’ programme is underlain by ethics of detachment and aims to create disconnection via discourses of empowerment and sustainability, this is at odds with the local moral economy of connection, which is underlain by the ethics of Islamic charity and patronage, and in which hierarchical differences are explicit. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

The paper analyses the best practices and lessons learnt to date and explores the practical issues to implement CCT poverty reduction programmes in Muslim countries. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on the qualitative assessment drawn from CCTs implementation in Muslim countries, namely Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey. The methodology also identifies the practical issues including the use of Islamic instruments to implement CCT poverty reduction programmes. Findings - The analysis in Muslim countries suggests that CCT programmes have had a positive effect and that the costs are relatively affordable if implemented with appropriate programme designs. In many cases, there have been positive secondary effects over and above the primary goal of poverty reduction. The paper also argues that the concept of CCTs is in line with the underlying principle of Islam to eradicate poverty via cash distribution approach. Originality/value - A decade long experience in some Muslim countries demonstrates that social cash transfers (including CCTs) have a significant impact on reducing poverty and vulnerability and promoting human development. Since none of CCT programmes in Muslim countries explore and integrate the potential of Islamic instruments (Zakat, Sadaqat, Awqaf and Qard Al-Hassan), it is timely for governments, multinational development institutions and non-profit organizations to utilize these instruments to tackling poverty. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

MEs have always faced difficulties in accessing loans or financing from the banking industry (conventional as well as Islamic) for a number of reasons. This study aims at evaluating several existing models of conventional and Islamic microfinance for MEs in Indonesia to find the best existing microfinance model to support sustainable rural development. The results show that the best conventional Grameen model is Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa; the best Islamic Grameen model is KUBE Sejahtera No. 21; the best conventional rural bank model is BKK Purwodadi; the best Islamic rural bank model is Amanah Ummah; the best conventional micro-banking unit model is BRI Unit; and the best Islamic micro-banking unit model is BSM Warung Mikro. The overall best micro finance institutions (MFIs) are Koperasi Mitra Dhuafa (cGrameen), BRI Unit (cMBU) and UGT (BMT). Moreover, the best financing program is offered by KUBE (iGrameen), the best social-development program is provided by KUBE (iGrameen), the best MFI performance is by Amanah Ummah (Islamic Rural Bank) and the best outreach is carried out by BRI Unit (cMBU). The most important sustainability criteria are: (1) Aid Independence (MFI Performance); (2) Coverage (Outreach); (3) Savings Program (Social Development Program); (4) Profitability (MFI Performance); (5) Risk Mitigation (Financing Program); (6) Social Services (Social Development Program); (7) Pick-Up Service (Financing Program); and (8) Average Financing (Outreach). Finally, the Cooperative-BMT model, which is operated more as a social business institution, is the most balanced sustainable model. © 2014, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

The introduction of the concept of sustainability to the field marked hopes to overcome problems threatening heritage sites. There are general concepts guiding sustainable conservation. However, heritage specifics play important roles in achieving sustainability, and may direct the formulation of sustainable concepts to be applied. This paper is an attempt to add to the discourse of heritage sustainability by discussing buildings managed through a tradition of Islamic waqf in the World Heritage Stone Town of Zanzibar. It examines sustainability in terms of its financial, social, managerial, and environmental aspects. The relatively good survival rate of waqf buildings in the old town over several centuries suggests sustainable and transmissible genes within the tradition. Waqf was found to elaborate ways to strike a balance between heritage consumption and use, avoiding gentrification, and enabling collective urban conservation. It further suggests that sustainable conservation cannot avoid monetary sacrifices, and if it is to be sustainable in the long term it should be inherent in the heritage itself. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Conclusions: Hypertension, smoking and diabetes mellitus are major risk factors for stroke in this poor population and should be the main targets for primary and secondary prevention of stroke. Availability of free medicines and developing stroke units can go a long way in reducing mortality and improving rehabilitation of such patients.},

Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an extensive review of microfinance with the objective of building a case for Islamic banking to participate in a microfinance initiative. Findings – As reviewed in this paper, microfinance requires innovative approaches beyond the traditional financial intermediary role. Among others, building human capacity through social intermediation and designing group-based lending programmes are proven to be among the effective tools to reduce transaction costs and lower exposure to numerous financial risks in relation to providing credit to the rural poor. This paper also suggests the use of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) as one of the possible alternatives for Islamic banks channelling funds to the poor. Research limitations/implications – Islamic banks may benefit from the spectrum of Shariah-compliant sources of funds and offer a wide array of financing instruments catering for different needs and demands of their clients. Furthermore, the use of a bankruptcy-remote entity like SPV can protect Islamic banks from any adverse effect of microfinance activities. Originality/value – The analysis here is valuable in drawing the attention of Islamic banking practitioners to the fact that they can actually practise microfinance without undermining their institutional viability, competitiveness and sustainability. This is evident from the proposed model to incorporate SPV into their microfinance initiatives. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Then, this study looks at four main issues, namely how the structure of the commitee, the management of such system, fund rising strategy, and people accessibility to this welfare system. In order to deal with this, it is used some frameworks namely; firstly, the welfare strategy as proposed by Spicker (1995) including economic production, redistribution, and solidarity. Secondly, the concept of welfare offered by Azmi (1991), Midgley (1997), and Zastrow (2004). This research took place in North and South Wonorejo, a village located in Magelang district, Central Java. Finding of this research shows that this scheme has operated conventionaly and has not contributed much on enhancing people welfare. There is no formal institution that organizes all element of such scheme. As the social welfare institution, this system ideally offers program, benefits and services that help people meets those social, economic, educational and health needs. However, there is no specific program for the poor people offered by the committee of the Islamic welfare scheme. © 2012, Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies.; Studi ini berusaha mengkaji praktik system kesejahteraan dalam Islam (seperti zakat, wakaf, shadaqah, infak, hibah dan qurban) dalam hubungannya dengan masyarakat miskin di wilayah pedesaan.

This paper also discusses the governance of waqf management as a source of funds for Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach - This research uses content analysis method to examine various literatures that discuss the concept and management of waqf. Findings - The characteristics of cash waqf such as permanence, irrevocability and perpetuity differentiate waqf from other type of donations. Therefore, cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance needs to be sustainable. Good corporate governance is vital to ensure the sustainability. As the donors of cash waqf do not aim to make financial profit, waqf-based Islamic MFIs will be able to provide low-cost capital to the poor entrepreneurs. Furthermore, to ensure the perpetuity of the waqf, it is suggested that only revenue from the waqf property should be used for microfinance fund. Social implications - The cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance will help the micro entrepreneurs to get low-cost capital without collateral. At the same time, public can donate any amount they afford to contribute to cash waqf. Originality/value - The creation of a cash waqf-based Islamic MFI must observe the issues of agency conflicts and the right of stakeholders to a transparent management. This paper emphasizes the importance of good governance in managing the waqf property as a source of fund for Islamic MFIs. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses that the climate change, natural resource shortages, fuel crisis and global financial crisis, etc. will not go away just because there is a recession. In this regard, Shari’ah compliant finance has a broader responsibility to consider societal goals and should be preparing for the post-credit crunch world. The paper evaluates the performance of Shari’ah compliant sustainable funds using the traditional measures of performance in relation to risk-adjusted benchmarks to see if there is any ethical effect. Findings – The paper advocates that preventing future market meltdowns and avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a new era of longterism in Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The study assesses the performance of the Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The result shows that Shari’ah compliant funds outperformed the conventional benchmark and therefore, the challenge for Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing is not to become like conventional investing but, rather, to replace. Research limitations/implications – Shari’ah compliant sustainable finance is a recent phenomena and therefore, rigorous analytical predication of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing variables are at present not possible using evolutionary and complex system approaches; however, such system can be fruitfully studied in future through simulation methods and certain types of econometric modeling when the long-term data will be made available. Originality/value – As the credit crunch has evolved into a full-blown economic crisis, many have turned to the Shari’ah compliant finance to provide a route map out of recession. With an increasing number of conventional banks and corporations struggling to find funds to support their businesses, Shari’ah compliant financial institutions represent a potential solution to bridge the liquidity gap in the global markets. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The Islamic micro-investment model (IMIM) aims to harness the role of the Waqf/philanthropic sector to empower micro-entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers use the survey technique to investigate the micro-entrepreneurs’ intention to adopt the model. A total of 400 questionnaires are distributed with 207 responses being returned (51.75 per cent). In this study, a structural model is tested to examine the relationship of the behavioural intention to adopt Islamic micro-investment with the attitude towards behaviour, subjective norm, normative belief and behavioural belief. Findings: The findings of the research show that, overall, the model fits the data and can be used to advance Islamic micro-finance in Bangladesh. However, out of the four hypotheses tested, only two are accepted vis-à-vis the influence of behavioural belief and normative belief on attitude and subjective norm, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The research suggests the need for an awareness programme on Islamic micro-finance and the role of Waqf in the economic empowerment of the populace. Practical implications: The IMIM aims to harness the role of the Waqf/philanthropic sector to empower micro-entrepreneurs. Social implications: The model of Islamic micro-finance may empower poor micro-entrepreneurs and harnesses the potential of Waqf for socio-economic development, thereby, among others, reducing the cost of capital. Originality/value: Only a few studies have been conducted on micro-finance from an Islamic perspective in Bangladesh. The IMIM, which has been developed by Muhammad (2012) and tested in Nigeria, is the first to be validated through an empirical study in Bangladesh. Thus, testing the viability of IMIM in the Bangladesh context will certainly add value for the clients, institutions and policymakers in Islamic micro-finance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to develop an integrated waqf-based Islamic microfinance (IsMF) for poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) have been constrained by the high cost of funds, high interest rate charges and poor human resource quality of the recipients. Islamic MFIs have recently evolved with the hope of overcoming these financial, ethical and human capital deficiencies faced by the conventional financial institutions. Moreover, a good number of integrated models have been proposed to enhance the role played by Islamic MFIs. Most of these models, however, lack empirical justifications. Design/methodology/approach – The research uses survey techniques. A total of 381 respondents were included in the survey. The integrated waqf-based Islamic microfinance model (IWIMM) was earlier on developed using literature and intellectual discussions. There are six constructs presenting the IWIMM, namely, waqf resources, IsMF, takaful, project financing, human resource development and poverty alleviation. In the survey instrument, 45 items represent the six constructs, but only 26 items have been retained after factor analysis. Structural equation modelling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. Findings – The results show that there are significant relationships between IsMF and takaful, waqf resources and human resource development, takaful and human resource development, IsMF and human resource development and, waqf resources and project financing. The results also indicate that poverty alleviation is possible through the integration of these constructs. Research limitations/implications – Though the paper has studied conventional and Islamic MFIs in Bangladesh, one of the populated Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries and also where poverty incidence is high, further studies need to be conducted in other OIC member countries to adopt the model in line with practical and regulatory environment of those countries. Similarly, the study is based on the perception of the respondents, which limits the generalization of the result. Practical implications – The paper proposed a model that has the potential of being applied for poverty alleviation programmes in most of the OIC member states. Originality/value – The present paper has developed an IWIMM for poverty reduction. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The researcher also interviewed respondents from four institutions that were beneficiaries of the Waqf Fund Scheme. Findings: The findings of this research show that the endowment fund scheme plays an important role in the economic development of the Muslim community in Penang. The Waqf Fund Scheme contributes by way of providing a financing facility towards the acquisition of waqf assets or through cash support channelled to associations or committees of a masjid. Research limitations/implications: This study only focuses on Waqf Fund Scheme which was established by MAINPP. Practical implications: This study is expected to contribute to the improvement of the Waqf Fund Scheme management. Originality/value: The paper is the first attempt to address the Waqf Fund Scheme contributions by MAINPP, particularly in Penang. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

By Showing how Islamic charitable organizations have attempted to create welfare programmes under the dakwah scheme, it investigates whether inclusive attitudes towards beneficiaries with different religious backgrounds have characterised Islamic social activism in ŉon-Islamic’ regions. As a Muslim minority area, post-disaster Nias Island has increasingly become a place where Islamic charitable associations and dakwah movements from outside Nias have attempted to deliver aid as well as to assist the communities, notably the Muslim minority population. As the outer islands and isolated regions have become an arena of contestation for religious missionaries, Muslim preachers to a certain extent should compete with Christian missionaries and indigenous religious groups. By way of a case study, this paper also examines the way in which Islamic charitable associations, negotiate between serving the Muslim community through dakwah, and serving humanity at large through social welfare activities. © 2012, State Islamic University of Sunan Ampel.

This study was motivated by the monthly official zakat distribution towards asnaf Muallaf that did not differentiate the true urban-rural cost of living differences. Differences in urban and rural poverty lines that did not reflect the actual urban-rural cost of living differences will provide a misleading picture of the distributional impact of development, which usually involves urban sector expansion. In a dualistic economy, one of the ways the poor benefit from development is through expansion of job opportunities in the modern predominantly urban sector, in addition to increases in productivity in the traditional predominantly rural sector. Thus, this study aims to identify the dispersal of Muallaf in terms of urban-rural poverty that involved in allocation of zakat distribution. In defining poverty between urban and rural areas, therefore, one should ensure the differences in the cost of living between these two areas. The finding suggest that, a huge of amount of zakat been allocated to the development of asnaf Muallaf in the state of Selangor especially in urban area. However, most of zakat distribution on Muallaf goes to urban region which higher in cost of living without considering a set of prices including a broader bundle of goods and services representative of the purchases of consumers in different region. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.},

The practice of zakat administration is basically designed to develop community-based programs among the poor and not struggle for Islamization or the politicization of Islam. Marketing zakat agencies does not attempt to commercialize religion; rather it is committed to the objective advancement about the effectiveness of religious teachings in Muslim communities. Marketing zakat to the public tries to demonstrate its role as the vanguard of social justice especially for the benefit of the destitute and needy. The proliferation of statesponsored zakat agencies (BAZNAS) vis-a-vis community-based zakat organization (LAZ) is not a case of state-initiated Islamization. It is rather an attempt at regulating public affairs, including zakat funds, within the state administration.},

	abstract = {Introduction Equitable access to surgical care is necessary for improving global health. We report on the performance, financial sustainability, and policy impact of a free-of-cost multispecialty surgical delivery program in Karachi, Pakistan built upon local private philanthropy. Materials and Methods We evaluated trends in surgical service delivery, expenditures, and philanthropic donations from Indus Hospital's first 5 years of operation (2007-2012), projected these over the hospital's current expansion phase, compared these to publicly accessible records of other philanthropic hospitals providing surgical care, and documented the government's evolving policies toward this model. Results Between 2007 and 2012, Indus Hospital treated 40,012 in-patients free of cost, 33,606 (84%) of them for surgical procedures. Surgical procedures increased fivefold to 9,478 during 2011-2012 from 1,838 during 2007-2008. Bed occupancy increased to 91% from 65% over the same period. External surgical missions accounted for less than 0.5% of patients served. Ninety-eight percent (98%) of all philanthropic donations-totaling USD 26.6 million over 2007-2012-were locally generated. Zakat (obligatory annual religious alms in the Islamic faith) constituted 34% of all donations, followed by unrestricted funds (24%) and donations-in-kind (24%), buildings (12%), grants (5%), and return on investments (1%). Overall, donations received between 2007 and 2012 increased sevenfold, with Zakat increasing 12-fold. During 2013-2014, the Government of Pakistan provided land lease and annual operational grants totaling USD 9 million. Conclusions Local philanthropy can sustain and grow the provision of free, high-quality surgical care in lowincome settings, and encourage the development of hybrid government-philanthropic models of surgical care. © Socié té Internationale de Chirurgie 2014.},

	abstract = {Islam has outlined 4 important elements to achieve fruitful life in the duniya and the akhirah. A famed hadith of Rasulullah (peace be upon him) meaning "Four things that will bring joy to a person, which is (owning) a pious woman (wife), a good house (spacious), a good neighbour, and a great vehicle" (Hadith narrated by Ibnu Hibban. It is clear from this hadith that Islam emphasised ownership of a comfortable home. The polemic remains that with skyrocketing housing prices in the market, would the low and middle income groups afford housing that is safe, comfortable and secure? Realising the importance of living in a secure and safe house, this study aims at investigating the possibility of leveraging the upward trend of waqf real estate development in empowering the Muslims' economy in the country. Towards this end, the authors have conducted a study by collating primary and secondary data obtained from the Penang State Islamic Religious Council (Majlis Agama Islam Pulau Pinang) for analysis. Thus the Penang Islamic Council is the study site. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 2 waqf officials who are in charge of coordinating waqf real estate developments in Penang. Based on the study conducted, it was found that Penang State Islamic Religious Council has succeeded in enhancing value added to waqf real estate developments through the implementation of 9 housing project developments using the ijarah concept. The Penang State Islamic Religious Council has enabled the low medium income groups to stay in comfortable and safe housing by utilising such holistic and efficient waqf product developments under shariah guidelines. © 2016 The Authors.},

Data was gathered from the Welfare and Value (WaVe) research program in 13 cities and 12 countries 2005–2009. The research was conducted through observation and in-depth research with a descriptive approach to the complexity of majority–minority relations in each town, followed by an analytical phase which addressed various factors in relation to social cohesion, values, minorities, and gender. In this article, the data from the WaVe study was coded and analyzed, mainly to explore the way Zakat is implemented in the European context and within the framework of different contextual welfare regimes using Esping-Andersen typology and Van der Ven institutional model on religious & social identity. The results confirm the dominant role of Caritas and Diaconia but with emerging & innovative Zakat in some countries and a marginal role in mainly Eastern Europe.

Design/methodology/approach - It conducts a thorough and critical review of the literature on relevant performance measurement literature of third sector organizations and waqf institutions. Findings - The findings suggest that an effective PMS is undoubtedly significant in promoting good governance and ethical management of waqf institutions. However, the current practice of performance measurement in waqf institutions is less standardized and does not cover its entire aspects of performance as a religious as well as a voluntary organization. It is also found that most waqf institutions' management and researchers primarily rely on financial reporting and economic indicators to report to the stakeholders about the performance of waqf institutions. Practical implications - The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, the authors develop a contingency framework for assessing performance of waqf institutions. Second, the authors outline eight necessary steps that can serve as guidelines for waqf institutions in designing their own comprehensive PMS. Originality/value - The novelty of this paper lies in highlighting the feasibility of adopting qualitative approaches by waqf institutions. This study hopes to shed light on a standard measurement system that can be adopted by the waqf institutions to ensure efficiency and sustainability of the waqf institutions, not just in Malaysia but in the Muslim world. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The paper concludes that Islamic waqf in Palestine is certainly not an invitation to the authority of the government to dominate the area of benevolent (caring, generous) activities in society but quite the opposite; from its beginning, the establishment of waqf was a clear representation of creating a third sector related to philanthropy (charities) that is kept away from both the profit-motivated behaviour of individuals and the authority-dominated action of the government and could be developed and adopted today in our society as a sustainable approach to the management of cultural heritage.},

	abstract = {The rise of party-based Islamic charities has had a profound impact on the nature of philanthropic activities in contemporary Indonesia, and stimulated a new debate over the issue of the politics of benevolent acts. Over the past few years, in line with the increase of the influence of the Islamic factor in Indonesian politics, there have been a number of political parties which actively engaged with social welfare activities through the newly-established Islamic charitable organizations. The close ties between charitable organizations and political parties may lead to the new patterns of Muslim social and political activism, and to the new forms of political clientelism. This article analyzes the vibrant effort of political parties in sponsoring the inception and operation of Islamic charitable organizations in the post New Order era, and investigates how political clientelism has been established through charity practices. This paper compares the roles of charitable organizations set up by the nationalist and Islamist parties in formulating strategies to promote their political interest. Based on three political parties studied in this article, which are the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), Golkar Party, and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), this paper argues that the practice of charity has become a popular way used by politicians to patronize their constituents, but at the same time, this practice has weakened the Muslim perspective of development and social change.},

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative method is used in this research. An extensive review of the literature has been conducted. Latest literature on refugees, microfinance has been critically examined beside the current cash waqf models. Findings: Empirical studies have shown that many refugees are equipped with marketable skills and talents that can be utilised to improve their socio-economic situations. The proposed model – cash waqf refugee microfinance fund (CWRMF) – is structured to extend microfinance to potential refugee micro entrepreneurs. To address the lack of collateral, which is a requirement to gain any microfinance, CWRMF has been incorporated with a takaful unit (cooperation) by which refugees may guarantee each other. Additionally, the model has also been structured to address the challenge of sustainability of the institution that would provide microfinance. Hence, a reserve fund has also been integrated into the model. Practical implications: CWRMF represents a potential model to be implemented by humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and aid agencies to support livelihood of refugees in particular for Muslim refugees. Positive outcome is expected from the implementation of this model. This is because of the various advantages of microfinance programs not only on refugees but also on concerned NGOs, host populations and donor parties. Additionally, this paper is a set of primarily thoughts aims to open the door wider for more researchers to explore the potential of cash waqf as one of the instruments to finance refugee microenterprises and business activities. Originality/value: Recently cash waqf has been into several models for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation.

It is argued that the number of Muslims living in poverty is growing faster than the number of Zakat payers which reflect the low compliance towards the act of paying Zakat among Muslims. Thus, this study seeks to understand the religious practice and attitude of the Zakat payers that influence their willingness to comply towards the behaviour of paying Zakat. This study provides the theoretical insight by combining the element in Theory of Reasoned Action (1980) and the measurement of Muslim Religiosity-Personality Inventory (2005) in a single model which provides multidimensional findings in Zakat compliance behaviour. Data from 217 respondents were recorded and the respondents were consisted of public and private sectors? employees. The data were then analysed using SPSS. The existing variable; attitude, subjective norm and religiosity were found to be statistically significant on Zakat compliance behaviour. The implications of this study will enhance the Zakat institution to increase the Zakat collection in the future and to improve the institutional way by focusing on specific target group to increase the voluntary behaviour in order for the members to pay Zakat. It may also helps in developing an extensive way of understanding the individual?s behaviour on complying towards the act of Zakat and empowering the community development in Malaysia. © 2018, Universita Putra Malaysia.},

Subsequently, these major aspects of the green policy and guidelines are linked to the main references of the Shariah, i.e. the holy Quran and Sunnah of Prophet [peace be upon him (pbuh)]. Findings: Various verses of the holy Quran and teachings of Prophet (pbuh) related to the major categories of Green policy and guidelines are being presented to show the compliance with Shariah.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor among zakat recipients in southwest Nigeria. It seeks to explain the criteria and basis used in determining the most deprived among zakat recipients considering the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and modern-day situations. Design/methodology/approach - Out of 200 questionnaires that were randomly distributed among the recipients of zakat from Al-Hayat Relief Foundation and Zakat and Sadaqat Foundation in southwest Nigeria, only 150 were completed. Headcount poverty index, poverty gap index, multi-dimensional index on standard of living, income ranges and monthly per-capita household expenditures using the national workers' minimum wage as poverty threshold were adopted for analyzing the data collected. Findings - On the basis of the income range of the recipients, 128 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor, whereas on using the MMPCHE 93 out of 150 recipients were found to be poor. Both results were further classified into hardcore poor, moderately poor and just poor recipients. The multi-dimensional index on standard of living was also used to capture poverty in terms of deprivation in standard of living, such as nonavailability of electricity, drinking water, cooking fuel, sanitation, flooring and assets. Research limitations/implications - A limited number of recipients were evaluated in this study, and hence it would be difficult to generalize. Also, some recipients had difficulty in answering the survey questionnaire used in this study, which reduced the amount of information derived. Thus, an in-depth interview method coupled with a survey can be used in future studies. Practical implications - The implication of this result is either that the threshold and measures adopted are not capturing the poor and the needy or that the zakat institutions are not reaching out enough to the poor and the needy eligible to receive zakat. This paper suggests the introduction of a more uniform and comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold for the poor and the needy that will continuously be examined by Shariah scholars and researchers to best engage with the modern-day situation. Social implications - This paper examines the measures of poverty and concludes on the introduction of a well-comprehensive threshold that is Shariah compliant and based on the plight of the modern-day poor and needy, which can go a long way in achieving the objectives of zakat. Originality/value - This study recommends a more comprehensive zakat-based poverty threshold that will capture the multi-dimensional nature of poverty in the present day for better outreach to the most deprived needy and poor. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The institution of waqf has played its role in poverty alleviation and socioeconomic development through history, especially in the Islamic history. Until today, this institution still plays an important role especially in Muslim countries. Still, there are many potential mechanisms in order to make it more effective to alleviate poverty and for financing the education of the poor. On the other hand, Islamic waqf bank is a special designed financial institution in Islam. This bank will benefit the student and also their parents, due to its unique structure that could finance students' education in term of fees and cost of living. Islamic waqf bank use the concept of cash waqf in funding the education. Cash waqf is a trust fund established with money to support services for mankind's benefits in the name of Allah. The gifted capital was "transferred" to borrowers for certain period, which was then spent for all sorts of pious and social purposes inclusive for the investment objectives. The objective of this article is to examine the need of students and inclination among Muslim public to contribute for the establishment of Islamicwaqf bank. The general findings of this article shows that there is a high demandamong students and strong willingness among public to contribute for the establishment of Islamic waqf bank. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

The potential of using waqf as a source of funding for such practices has not been vastly explored. The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the current corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) and to examine the viability of using waqf for the purpose of CSR. Content analyses of the annual and sustainability reports of twenty-four (24) IFIs in Malaysia for a four (4) year period from 2010 to 2013 were undertaken to provide insights on their current CSR practices. The CSR disclosure items were categorized into vital and recommended items, where the vital elements denote key activities that are essential and are to be undertaken while the recommended items refer to discretionary activities that may be carried out. Semi-structured interviews with three (3) Waqf experts were also carried out to draw their opinions about waqf. The results of the study revealed that for the vital items, the IFIs in Malaysia were focusing their CSR practices on the workplace while for the recommended items the focus was on community issues. Corporate waqf is viewed as a viable alternative that organizations can use to help address social issues of the community. However, there are critical issues that needed to be dealt with to transformed waqf practices in the country. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {What is the function and future prospect for older and more historic neighborhoods in an atypical Islamic city? This study case from Amman, Jordan, identifies three main factors that have circumscribed the neighborhood's urban development: changes to landuse, rent-control bylaws, and processes of land succession. A survey of the ownership registry for 666 plots for the period 1946-2002 reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the processes of land succession. Such processes, based as they are on Islamic thinking about inheritance, are expected to be the most persistent factor affecting the future form and function of the neighborhood. The effect of such processes of land succession may be compared to the function observed elsewhere for waqf property in terms of contributing to the sustainability of traditional crafts and trades in old bazaars; in the case presented here, however, processes of land succession, are contributing to the creation of opportunities for development and redevelopment by freeing a sizeable percentage of available land, built or unbuilt, with the passing of every generation. Thus, in contrast to the often cited adverse effect such processes have in rural areas when leading to the fragmentation of agricultural farming areas, the same processes are here found to be conducive to urban regeneration and redevelopment. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

There is, however, no doubt that the people of all the Muslim countries including Pakistan do observe certain Islamic traditions. The giving of alms and gifts to help the needy on a voluntary basis is still widely practised. This study using HIES data for 1987-88 finds that Infaq does help in poverty alleviation. Its impact particularly on the poverty gap and severity of poverty index is significant.

	abstract = {Abstract: Since the beginnings of Islam, awqāf or religious endowments have been the medium through which various public services (i.e. schools, hospitals, and mosques) have been provided to communities. Historically, endowments were both insulated from state authority and an emanation of imperial and/or state power. Modern day Muslim scholars have taken a renewed interest in waqf, particularly as Muslim societies look to revive those indigenous institutions which promote cultural sustainability. This paper examines perceptions of the role of waqf in Muslim society as evidenced in current online fatāwā and writings by Muslim scholars. These sources are drawn from English-medium, Muslim web organizations and sites which have particular appeal among Muslims living in the West. This literature propagates a historical narrative of waqf which highlights the institution's moral significance, civic identity, and economic efficiency, and plays down its pre-nineteenth-century links to state power and its potential inefficiency. According to modern day scholars, endowments, with the proper legal framework in place, can promote civil society and sustainability. In a bid to examine these issues, the paper analyzes how online sources address the historical development of waqf and legal mechanisms shaping the regulation of endowments. © 2014, © 2014 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

We present the use of Sukuk, Islamic Finance instruments used for the realization of real assets in the Shari'ah-compliant Finance, that prohibits interest rates as in conventional financial markets. The cost of a PV power plant able to achieve grid parity was identified. Sukuk could limit the extent of leverage associated with financing. The minimum threshold of the fixed share that makes the investment profitable and bankable will be shown. Results evidenced the practical use of Shari'ah-compliant sukuk instruments to enhance processes of technological innovation in the energy production sector, and could provide the policy makers a quick glance about different financing instruments available for the renewables sector in the framework of the reduction of GHG emissions and the consequent negative effects of climate change. © 2016 AEIT.},

	abstract = {Zakat which literally means growth, extension and purification is a premium on all forms of accumulated productive wealth and on a variety of agricultural produce. In Pakistan till recent years people used to pay their zakat to the needy on self-assessed basis without involving state functionaries. Following the Sunni Muslim view that collection and disbursement of one of the functions of an Islamic state, a system to this effect was introduced for the first time in Pakistan 1980. Given the experience of one decade now, it would be useful to see as to what extent the system as practiced in Pakistan has the potential to eradicate poverty from society. The present paper is an attempt in this direction. It is drawn from an overall study of the zakat system in Pakistan based on primary data collected through a random sample survey. Section one outlines the zakat system as practiced in Pakistan followed by a brief description of the sample survey used for collection of data partly used in this paper in section two. In section three we present estimates of zakat potential of the existing zakat system and then compare the same with the actual needs of poverty eradication presented in section four. Finally, some tentative conclusions of the paper are presented in section five. The article concludes with comments by M. Anwar. -from Author},

	abstract = {This paper aims at exploring the administrative challenges of waqf as a prominent mechanism of poverty alleviation and provision of social welfare services. Waqf is generally regarded to be one of the most effective ways of expressing philanthropy for sustaining the welfare of the needy, the poor, the family, and the society. Through this philanthropic institution, wealth is transferred from private ownership to public utility. Personal assets of useful value can be endowed in waqf for the all-round services of the society; religious, social, economic, and educational sectors, under certain conditions and regultaions laid down by the Sharī'ah. Right from the time of the Holy Prophet, waqf has been benefitting people and defraying public expenses as it served as an effective means of funding mosques, graveyards, orphanages, schools, hospitals, bakeries, warehouses, mills, and numerous humanitarian or religious foundations. Similarly, this institution was successfully financing agriculture, horticulture and water resources during the previous centuries, as it was used to cater for the aged, infirm, destitute, and even animals. However, with the advent of colonialism in the Islamic world and subsequent negative transformation of Islamic culture and tradition, this strategic financial institution eventually started to turn into a shadow of its former glorious status. By adopting the narrative approach of qualitative research method, this study analyses the current administrative problems facing waqf institution in a bid to finding their lasting solutions and resuscitating its humanitarian functions. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to shed some light on the roles of Islamic values and principles in encouraging households to enhance their livelihood and, therefore, alleviate their poverty. Design/methodology/approach – A structured and tested socio-economic questionnaire instrument was randomly distributed to 102 randomly selected households from the state of Penang in Malaysia. Data collected were analysed using one-way ANOVA tests. Findings – The results indicated that poverty can be fought with commitment, faith and guided principles based on faith. While the self-reliance degree remains indispensable in the development progress of individuals, communities and societies, dependence on others leads to disappointment and failure. Research limitations/implications – This study has its own limitations. First, the study did not consider the gender factor in the analysis. Second, only cash transfer (role of the government) was considered in the study, although other roles such as taxation and social services are probably equally important. Third, the discussion did not pay attention to how the proposed three constructs (Micro, Meso and Macro) are related. Lastly, as proposed by an anonymous reviewer, the present study did not take in consideration how Islamic philosophy perceives the share of responsibility to the three proposed constructs. Does Islam give similar weight to each of them? Practical implications – Sadakah and Waqf should be integrated with the financial systems to halt any misuse of the financial assistance offered to the poor. Social implications – Government assistance remains indispensable through providing the necessities of comfort and well-being to the hardcore poor such as housing, health-care facilities and cash transfer. Originality/value – This study enhances the understanding of how religious adherence and Islamic values influence households’ well-being and paves the way for further research on this crucial issue. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Al-Waqf (endowment) is a form of charity in Islam. Among its special features is that it is permanent and irrevocable while its benefits also go from one generation to another. It involves the transfer of property from the original owner to the cause of Allah. It is as old as the practice of Islam. At the beginning, simple assets such as farmlands, wells and orchards were endowed. Charity, in this respect, may include building of centers for education, hospitals, public facilities and residential houses in modern time. Regrettably, the practice of al-waqf is no more as popular as it was in the past. Although, rich people among Nigerian Muslims used to donate during their lifetimes for personal or community projects. In most cases, those projects die with their death since no portion of their wealth is endowed for them. This article therefore looked into the relevance of al-waqf as takāful-ijtimā‘i (social insurance) product at present. It examined the definition, significance, conditions of validity and administration of al-waqf. The study revealed that al-waqf can bring about a positive change, meaningful development and transformation in helping the poor and the needy in the community. It suggests that al-waqf should be integrated in the takāful (insurance) practices. © 2017 Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs.},

	abstract = {Financial inclusion (FI) is a global movement under the world bank programs and Alliance Financial Inclusion (AFI) which is sponsored by the Bill Gates Foundation. The aim of the movement is to ensure that the poor is able to access any financial services. The FI level in Indonesia achieved 32 %; it means 68% are financial transactions excluding the poor, whereas, the average figure in the world is just only 50%. The poverty rate in Indonesia is very high, it is reaching approximately 59%. Hence, FI is an urgent solution for the case of Indonesia. To tackle this issue, the Indonesian government has just started adopting FI by introducing the vision, the mission, and the concept for the efforts taken. The question is to what extent the appropriate model will be applied in Indonesia. There are two models: the AFI global model or top down model and another community model based on local values. There are pros and cons to the above issue. Some proponents have suggested the Islamic microfinance cooperative, i.e., the Baitul Mal Wa Tanwil (BMT) which is the offering of a solution based on its relationship to the poor. They do not agree with the global model. This study therefore attempts to evaluate the models and design the appropriate model for Indonesia which has special characteristics, i.e., cooperation, value driven culture, local wisdom, etc., which is neglected in most studies undertaken so far. This study is based on a qualitative approach done by conducting interviews of the stakeholders, using the deductive method to explore and design the model. This research revealed that the financial inclusion model based on Baitul Mal Wa Tanwil (BMT)-Cooperative is better in terms of flexibility and acceptability when compared to the global model. This is because Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world with wide distances, diverse cultures, values, customs, and religions. To deal with the distances, wide area, and efficiency issues, the ICT mobile phone should be suitably used. The implementation of the model will strengthen the unity of Indonesia and national issues.},

	abstract = {Poverty is the central problem to sustainable human development. While Islamic microfinance has been recognized as the best-fit alternative to conventional Microcredit which promises the same benefits based on Shariah. As the Islam provides the complete code of life, the religion covers poverty reduction as one of the premier agendas. Islam considers that poverty induces other indecent acts; therefore, poverty should be treated with much care. However, the Shari'ah encourages savings and investment rather than excessive consumer debt. Some of the most significant obstacles facing Islamic Micro Finance (IMFIs) lie in the rising costs, where the needs for implementation and follow-up to the field are greater than in conventional finance; poor awareness of systems and methods of Islamic finance among the target audience; and the execution of Islamic finance by certain authorities without having adequate knowledge in it, leading to wrong practices and loss of public confidence in Islamic finance. In addition to this, there is a scarcity of skilled personnel in the field of Islamic finance due to the lack of interest among academics in the Islamic finance in the Middle East region. Despite the prospects for microfinance, there are a number of specific challenges facing this industry under the Islamic financial systems, some of which include: There is an urgent need to build bridges between the religious institutions and the microfinance sector; the concept that there is a lack of convergence between the parties in terms of objectives; The challenge is to recognize the common grounds in human development, which will bring together these two parties; One of the challenges in addressing the sceptical perception prevalent among Muslim consumers, especially in the South Asian region, is about whether or not these products comply with the Shari'ah rules; and finally The Islamic finance industry needs to adapt and modify the range of products and operating models that are not used in accordance with the fundamental rules of Shari'ah in order to meet the needs of the poor.},

Although poverty alleviation strategies in Malaysia have been acclaimed success by United Nation Development Programme (UNDP, 2013), new form of poverty emerged in urban area as a result of rapid economic growth and development. Poverty is a multifaceted phenomenon and different societies have different perceptions of poverty. These will led to uncertainty in determining of poverty. Most of welfare institutions in Malaysia measure poverty from the monetary perspective using monthly income or expenditure. In practice, conventional institutions such as Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat Malaysia (JKMM) use monetary approach in determining poverty through the Poverty Line Income (PLI). While, Islamic institutions adopt the monetary approach in determining poverty using Had Al-Kifayah (HAK). The objective of this paper is to explain the concept and analyze the uncertainty factors that have contributed to the incidence of poverty in urban area using PLI and HAK method. This study would highlight the similarities and differences of both the methods. A survey aided by a structured questionnaire was carried out on 300 selected households in the state of Kuala Lumpur and 150 household datasets are obtained from Department of Zakat, Islamic Center, UTM, Johor. This empirical study will able to use in designing case representation for case-based reasoning that will be implemented in future work.},

This paper sheds light on the multifaceted nature of sadaqaand how it is perceived not only as a means of spiritual purification, but also as factor of building socio-economic sustainability. This research draws on Islamic literature pertaining to the concepts, norms and laws of sadaqain Islam to provide a conceptual framework of analysis of charity and its respective practice in Islam and thus supplies researchers with the perspective necessary for further interpretation and analysis on Islamic philanthropy.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, Islamic Financial Institutions substantially increased their market share in Turkey, and demonstrated an impressive growth rate. In promoting this sector, Turkish entrepreneurs also make a moral claim, suggesting that their profit motivations are justified by a religious concern because wealth generated through halal means indirectly helps out the poor and the needy. Yet, though these entrepreneurs frequently invoke religious morals to justify their strategies, Islamic banks appear only occasionally engaged in systematic acts of charitable giving. Why do conventional banks in Turkey engage more systematically with social welfare-related philanthropy projects while their Islamic counterparts seem less interested in similar activities? The article brings state back in and finds that this variation is an unintended consequence of the current government's social policy reforms. After election into office in 2002, Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi (AKP, Justice and Development Party) promoted greater private involvement in public goods provision in return for offering economic privileges to partisan business groups-including Islamic banks. During this process, the government encouraged religious business groups to work with faith-based NGOs and local government agencies, capitalizing on existing partisan and solidarity networks to increase political returns. Consequently, while Islamic banks rely on religious associations and channel their contribution through Islamic charity NGOs that command a broader geographic outreach in collaboration with local government actors, conventional banks that are not part of similar societal networks either carry out independent corporate philanthropy schemes or collaborate with national government agencies. © 2015 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).},

	abstract = {Since World War II social welfare has been an idea very much cherished by developed countries especially in Europe such as United Kingdom, Sweden and Norway. On the other hand Muslim countries across Asia and Africa are known or depicted as less developed and plagued by poverty. Several Malay Kingdoms throughout the Golden Chersonese together with Sabah and Sarawak in Borneo formed a new country known as Malaysia inherited some welfare policies from its former British rule. This paper intends to investigate and highlight the dimension of social welfare and social protection policy in Malaysia besides the establishment of Welfare Department during the British colonial times. It was found that the welfare concept has been part and parcel of the life of Malay people since their conversion to Islam long before the arrival of the European invaders. The welfare concept is derived from the Quran. Besides revealing the matters of faiths, the Quran also contains principles concerning relationship among human beings. Every member of society are taught and encouraged to take care the welfare of others. The act of charity towards the poor and needy has been mentioned by Allah in the Quran. This paper concluded that Malaysia as a predominantly Muslim country embraces the callings of welfare as stated in the Quran through wealth redistribution. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

Adopting qualitative data collection method, an in-depth interview method is used to retrieve information on the expenditure pattern of the households and the underlying reasons for doing so. Five households with various demographic backgrounds are chosen from Mukim Laka Temin, Kubang Pasu District. This study discovers the expenditure of each poor household is managed by a woman and each household has its own unique livelihood strategies which are based on the type of jobs of the household members and the households’ spending arrangements. All households prioritize their expenditure, food as the main priority, followed utility bills, transportation, education and others. Most households constantly receive financial supports from various sources such as government agencies and individuals in terms of zakat and donation. The study suggests the livelihoods strategies adopted by the households can be translated into opportunities for the poor households to improve their socio-economic status if the members receive proper provision of trainings and capitals. © 2016, International Journal of Business and Society.

	abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to know the present structure and move of the Islamic banks of Pakistan as well as current issues and challenges for Islamic microfinance. However, this is based on perceptions of the Islamic bankers, regulators and micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders, as they are the key players in the credit market. Design/methodology/approach – The study gathered relevant information through conducting field survey. Two questionnaires were designed for the survey. One questionnaire was administered to survey 270 micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders in three major cities of Pakistan. Another survey deals with the perceptions of Islamic bankers. In total, 100 people from middle and top management were surveyed from five full-fledged Islamic banks of Pakistan. The SPSS software, version 16, was used for questionnaire reliability and descriptive analysis to analyse the data. Findings – In general, the study found the strong opinions of the respondents speak in favour of Islamic microfinance under a system of profit and loss sharing. Conversely, the majority of the clients also feel that Islamic banks do not encourage lower-income micro-entrepreneurs. In addition, the study found that Islamic microfinance is constrained by lack of knowledge, experience and professionalism of the supporting staff; however, Islamic bankers have shown great consensus that Islamic banks should offer Islamic microfinance products and instruments to respond to the needs of the poor for poverty alleviation. Research limitations/implications – The first limitation of the study is the meagre interest of micro-entrepreneurs and petty traders to participate in the survey. The second limitation of this work concerns the extremely busy schedule of top management and administrative impediment to approach and fix an appointment. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study provide insights to Islamic banks in diversifying their products by offering Islamic microfinance to the low-income entrepreneurs but with proper guidelines and policies. Practical implications – There is a need to educate the community towards the merits of Islamic banking system by developing a good information system using good visuals and professionally presented seminars, banners and arranging regular sessions with the business community. The growth and development of Islamic banking in the country largely depend on its customers’ enhanced knowledge and awareness about its products and services. Social implications – It is the responsibility of the community as well as of government to change the mindset of the poor that banks are meant to serve the interest of everybody, regardless of social, economic and political status. Originality/value – Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the area of Islamic microfinance by examining the perceptions of Islamic bankers and micro-entrepreneurs. This can help Islamic banks of Pakistan to design and formulate new administrative as well as operational procedures to serve the interest of the poor with commitment towards Islamic values. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Moreover, regression analysis is also employed to examine the impacts of financial outreach on the Nigerian economic growth. Findings - The authors find that Islamic moral transaction mode will moderate the sustainable Islamic banking business which can influence the sustenance of IMFBs and the well-being of the society through financial outreach.

In spite of the efforts exerted to reduce poverty and inequality, poverty is still widespread in Sudan. This study aimed at examining from an empirical point of view, the roles of zakat and knowledge in reducing poverty in Sudan during the period (1990-2009), using data collected from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) and Abdelmawla (2010). Two policy variables are incorporated in the empirical model namely, the percentage spent on poor out of total zakat funds and educational attainment (proxy for knowledge). By applying the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) technique, the results obtained signify that zakat and educational attainment impact significantly at the 1% level on reducing poverty in Sudan. The study recommends increasing educational attainment rates and improving the quality of education, which requires among other things, increasing expenditure on education at all levels, beside the care for adult literacy classes. In addition to that, raising the percentage spent on the poor out of total zakat funds is highly recommended to reduce inequality in the distribution of income. Income support should particularly be used for the part of the population with special needs. © 2014 Statistical Economic and Social Research. All Rights Reserved.},

Zakat agencies, with their charitable clinics, have recently gained strong support from both society and the government. They have, for example, tried to bring a community response to the current social economic challenges through the revitalization of the zakat and Islamic charity practice. Low-priced, accessible and free medical assistance for poorer families and small economic enterprises provided by the zakat agencies reflect the endeavours of middle class Indonesian Muslims to translate Islamic discourse on social welfare in a more concrete way. The rise of Islamic charitable clinics, whose origins and motives can partly be linked to the Islamic discourse of the welfare of the ummah [the Islamic community], is without doubt a consequence of emerging interpretations of the meaning and function of Islamic aid in contemporary Indonesian Islam.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to assess the potential of Islamic financing schemes for microfinancing purposes. Design/methodology/approach – The paper contends that Islamic finance has an important role to contribute for furthering socioeconomic development of the poor and small (micro) entrepreneurs without charging interest (read: riba'). Findings – Islamic finance offers various ethical schemes and instruments that can be advanced and adapted for the purpose of microfinance. Comparatively, qardhul hasan, murabahah, and ijarah schemes are relatively easy to manage and will ensure the capital needs (qardhul hasan), equipments (murabahah) and leased equipments (ijarah) for potential microentrepreneurs and the poor. Participatory schemes such as mudarabah and musharakah, on the other hand, have great potentials for microfinance purposes as these schemes can satisfy the risk sharing needs of the microentrepreneurs. Research limitations/implications – The paper is only conceptual and does not aim to empirically examine the issues or theories. However, the paper will definitely be useful to develop hypotheses for future research, especially in this relatively new area of Islamic microfinance. Practical implications – The Islamic concepts of microfinance will be of interest especially to many microfinance institutions. The paper will also be a good introduction to practitioners in the microfinance sector to understand the relevance and limitations of Islamic financing schemes. Originality/value – Islamic financing schemes are argued as having moral and ethical attributes that can effectively motivate microentrepreneurs to thrive. These schemes, however, require specialized skills in managing risks inherent in the structure of the contracts. In theory, different schemes can be used for different purposes depending on the risk profile of the microentrepreneurs. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Management of the tithe collection as well as its effective distribution will help develop the community. Thus, this paper aims to study the Islamic administration of tithe in two states, namely Aceh in Indonesia and Kedah in Malaysia. Both states have their own relationship in a context where they both have a large number of Muslims, the majority of which are ethnic Malays, and they constitute one of the early regions to accept Islam. The focus of the study is based on historical analysis, economic growth and development, as well as the contemporary scenario in the administration of tithe law. The study will investigate the role of tithe as a fund for community development within the state, its management as well as the administration of the law. For this purpose, the study is conducted using qualitative methods and interviews with a number of respondents in order to examine the administrative aspects of Islamic law on tithe. The finding shows that the strict enforcement of law, accompanied by institutions organised with manpower and focused objectives, will have an impact on the tithe collections as well as the confidence of community towards the institutions. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2012.},

	abstract = {The role of financial intermediation in a modern capitalist system hinges mainly on the taking and charging interest. While some Islamic scholars consider interest to be lawful for Muslims to take or charge on their transactions, many Islamic scholars consider charging or taking interest to be non-shari’ah compliant. It is against this backdrop that the paper sets out to provide a correct articulation of the meaning of ribā [interest/usury], which is the foundation stone on which the conventional financial institutions are based and examines its effects on the Nigerian economy. Using information about the forms and structure of socio-economic transactions during al-Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic) period in Makkah and during the Prophet’s time in Makkah and Madinah, we found that interest of all kinds is prohibited. The practice of interest payment in a modern capitalist economy is against the dictates of the Shari’ah. The article finds that debt servicing has badly affected the economic growth development of Nigeria. The article reveals a sharp increase in the amounts used to finance the country’s debt obligation. The debt servicing as a percentage of the capital expenditure has been increasing greatly since 2011 to till date. The percentage of debt servicing to capital expenditure in Nigeria from 1981 to 2015 has been very high for the country, with an average of over 59.0% under the 35 years considered in this study. In some years, this ratio was over 100.0% reaching its peak at 150.4% in 2003. In 2015, the ratio stood at 129.57%. This could account for low level of development in the country. The negative impact of debt servicing on the economy serves as a barrier to poverty alleviation, economic growth and development. © 2017. The Authors.},

Fueled by paternalistic state welfare policies and funded by the 1970s oil boom, most countries drastically expanded access to publicly provided social services and developed extensive health, education, and social protection systems. Islamic traditions of charity (for example, Zakat) and family support networks also helped countries manage social and economic risks. As a result, social infrastructures expanded rapidly, and key social indicators-such as child mortality rates, life expectancy, and literacy-show dramatic improvements in most countries. Nevertheless, major challenges remain. Poverty is a problem, with 30 percent of the region's population living on less than $2 a day. The low-income countries (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) have alarming levels of infant and maternal mortality and illiteracy, with limited resources to tackle these problems. In the middle- and high-income countries, health, education, and social protection systems must concentrate on targeting vulnerable populations and ensuring equity, quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability in the provision of services. What can be done to address the problems in the health, education, and social protection systems in the region?

One type of Islamic philanthropy is waqf which is simply recommended but has played a role not less important than zakat which is obligatory. Waqf in Indonesia is a case in point. However, this type of philanthropy does not obtain a serious attention from the state. It is in what is known as refom era (era reformasi) that waqf is given an important attention through the issuance of Waqf Act in 2004 by the state. This paper analyzes the background of legislation of waqf in terms of economics, regulations and politics. To analyze the issues, this paper utilizes content analysis as its method accompanied by political, historical and theological approaches. Meanwhile, the materials used in this paper are documents related to the issues under discussion such as the Bill of Waqf Act, process of legislation of waqf and the 2004 Waqf Act, supported by other materials relevant to the issues. This paper argues that although waqf is religious matter, it cannot be separated from state affairs because it helpful to increase social welfare for which the state is responsible, and at the same time the legislation of waqf has accommodated Muslim interest.},

Being thus guaranteed socio-economic well-being, these beneficiaries were antithetical to ruling elites in Muslim dynasties and Christian colonial powers, which led to the establishment of policies and institutions to control waqfs and check their growing influence. This development was not only counter to normative precepts but also set minority Muslims in predominantly Christian societies at odds with non-Muslim states. To what extent did civil policies and judgements influence waqfs? How did Muslims negotiate the secular state constructs vis-à-vis waqf practices? How did secular state control of waqfs influence the dynamics of Christian–Muslim relations? This discussion, based on ethnographic research in Kenyan coastal areas, employs two theoretical frameworks–Asad's ‘Islam as a discursive tradition’ and Scott’s concept of ‘symbolic (ideological) resistance’. The article draws mainly on the perspective of the Muslim minority in Kenya and argues that state control of waqfs in Kenya did not only interfere with normative practices but also partly laid the ground for the present-day economic and political marginalization and exclusion of Muslims, leading to suspicion and ambiguous relations with their Christian compatriots. © 2017 University of Birmingham.},

Historically, waqf played a significant role in the Islamic economic system, particularly in rendering exemplary welfare services in the areas of healthcare, education, social welfare, environmental, and other community-based programs. However, only a few success stories in recent history have institutionally utilized the properties of waqf under proper management to achieve its substantial objectives. This study uses the literature review as basis to analyze the reasons behind the successful utilization of waqf as an effective tool to ensure social welfare services in the past, as well as how this model can be replicated by considering current contexts.

	abstract = {Nazhir is one of the elements that must be fulfilled in the implementation of waqf. The existance of nashir is also one of the uniqueness of another form of management of Islamic Philantropic funds, namely zakat. Nazhir‘s role is to manage and empower waqf objects so that the existance of waqf objects can provide and bring benefits in a sustainable manner of the benefit of the general public (ummah). The results of the development of waqf that are managed professionally and by Nazhir who is trustworthy (amanah) and professional, and by the BWI Institute wil l bring benefits and for the public, both in the form of designating a development of mosque / musholla facilities, Islamic educational institutions, Islamic hospital development, or for the benefit of other people's economic empowerment assistance. This paper provides an overview of how the concept of the mandatory sector is seen in the formation and appointment of Nazhir Legal Entities in terms of managing waqf assets. The Voluntary sector is inherent in the basic principles of the practice of waqf. So the authors assume that a waqf asset that is managed by using the principle of 'mandatory', will have an impact and a large contribution to sustain the economy of the community. As is well known, there are quite a number of social institutions that sustainably show a large contribution to improving the welfare of the community, and this is sourced from and by endowment funds which are voluntarily submitted from the endowment. The forming of Regulation Number 28 of 2004 concerning Amendments to Regulation Number 16 of 2001 concerning Foundations is i n tended to better ensure legal certainty and legal order, as well as provide a correct understanding to the public regarding the Foundation, so that it can restore the function of the Foundation as a legal institution in order to achieve certain objectives in the field of social, religious and humanitarian.

Consequently, this study hopes to contribute to the development of waqf institutions in terms of human capital proficiency, the efficiency of operations and the effectiveness and sustainability of performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reviewed a significant body of relevant studies written on various aspects of IC, to highlight the significance of considering IC in the operation of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and waqf institutions. Findings: This study highlights the importance of IC in the operation of waqf institutions. It provides a platform that facilitates understanding of the existing obstacles and challenges in waqf institutions (such as lack of accountability, lack of funding, mismanagement and lack of trained labour, among others) and offers potential solutions through the consideration of knowledge and IC. Research limitations/implications: This study is a conceptual analysis of IC in the context of NPOs. Future studies should conduct empirical testing, which will provide more detailed discussion and enriching insights into the issue of IC and the performance of NPOs, particularly in the case of waqf institutions. Practical implications: This study provides several important implications for waqf institutions and other NPOs, as it sheds light on the consideration of knowledge and IC in their operations. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to discuss the issues of waqf in the light of IC and provide an integrated framework for the operation of waqf institutions. © 2020, Abdelkader Laallam, Salina Kassim, Engku Rabiah Adawiah Engku Ali and Buerhan Saiti.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development of waqf (Endowment) property is the mutawalli's responsibility to make the waqf property productive and can produce benefits that can enhance or increase the value of the waqf properties. The development that not only contributes to welfare but also to finance or income is considered as one of the forms of sustainable development. This proves that sustainable development of waqf property can contribute to the socio-economic development of Muslims. However, how far is the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf can be comprehended appropriately? What are the characteristics of sustainable waqf property development? How can the concept of sustainability of waqf property development be implemented? These questions led to this study to identify the concept of sustainability in the development of waqf property. This study utilised the exploratory research design. Sources are gained from primary and secondary data. The primary data are obtained through in-depth interviews of six waqf practitioners comprising the officials at the State Islamic Religious Council (MAIN), who has been involved in managing waqf properties for more than five years. Secondary data is obtained from previous studies, such as thesis, books, articles, journals, magazines, and other publications. These data are then analysed by using qualitative content analysis using ATLAS. ti Version 8.0 (AV8) software. The results of this study found three elements in the concept of sustainable development of waqf property. The analysis found that there are forms of sustainable development on waqf land that especially involves socio-economic development as it can generate funds and increase the value of waqf property. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

We argue that the existing credit guarantee scheme (CGS) relies on government funding, but that in the current Covid-19 pandemic it is experiencing unstable financial capability. Hence, the sustainability of the CGS program is questionable. We employ the input-output (I-O) approach to identify the expected impact if the proposed FGS is applied. We further substantiate the proposal with seven Indonesian Syariah experts’ opinions, of whom five suggest that the alternative scheme is acceptable. The simulation using I-O shows that if IDR1 trillion (out of IDR10 trillion from ZIS funds in 2019) is disbursed through the scheme, this will increase economic growth by 0.0117%, representing economic activities worth IDR1.235 trillion, and creating 2,151 new jobs. We further discuss the implications of the findings for the Islamic banking industry in the future and for regulators. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging fintech industry brings about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees. Despite the introduction of disruptive fintech services, the needs generated by unimproved conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic fintech has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary (waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how fintech start-ups in Finland and Malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major fintech sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (P2P) financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances fintech services to elevate social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding, changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest that Islamic fintech offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance decisions. © 2020 SERSC.},

The findings explain the perspectives of local community after receiving the assistance, including the identification of reduction in numbers of local people affected by diarrhoea. This information may validate the relationships between health, water and sanitation. Furthermore, the findings capture the involvement of local government in the project execution.

The approaches that are taken by both of Islamic financial services industry (IFSI) and its counterpart conventional financial services industry (CFSI) are almost similar. However, a distinguished approach is introduced by the Central Bank of Malaysia towards IFSI. While Sharīʽah provides holistic objectives in comparison to SDGs, the approach of value-based intermediation (VBI) opens a new pragmatic dimension for IFSI in providing impactful and beneficial services to the public at large. The end results of VBI are placed to reach the holistic objectives of Sharīʽah and in achieving complete sustainability of IFSI. This paper investigates the approach of VBI and its proposed implementation from Sharīʽah perspective. Depending on qualitative investigation, this paper also explores the practices of Islamic banks in applying VBI through Islamic social finance and its impacts. It is found that VBI facilitates Islamic banks to provide impactful services to their customers and other innovative strategies based on Islamic social finance. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess the feasibility of zakat distribution conducted by zakat community development program, one of the BAZNAS programs in Bringinsari village, Sukorejo subdistrict, Kendal Regency, Central Java using the zakat village index (IDZ). Design/methodology/approach: IDZ has five components in measuring the effectiveness of charity for the welfare of the community is the economic dimension, the dimension of education, dimension of health, social dimension of humanity and dimensions of da’wah. The economic dimension consists of four variables, namely, the presence of productive economic activities, trade centers and access to transportation and logistics services and the presence of access to financial institutions. Findings: Based on IDZ measurement in Bringinsari village, it is found that IDZ of this village is 0.47. It showed that the condition of the village is good enough. As the result of this calculation, Bringinsari village is under consideration to receive zakat funding. Research limitations/implications: This research will be done in Bringinsari village Sukorejo district, Kendal regency from April 1, 2018 until July 2, 2018. Practical implications: Based on the result of IDZ result done in Bringinsari Sukorejo district, Kendal regency, it is gained index calculation result for about 0.47. Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the village deserves to get zakat funding. Economic dimension is still low, 0.32. Therefore, in this case, a motivation to help villagers is needed. The exact program in improving the people in Bringinsari based on priority is economic, health, education program in accordance with IDZ calculation. Social implications: The welfare measurement of zakat receiver or mustahiq adopts welfare index (CIBEST). CIBEST model combines material and spiritual fulfillment of human needs quadrants. This index is split into four categories, namely, welfare, material poverty, spiritual poverty and absolute poverty (Puskas BAZNAS, 2016). Originality/value: Based on measurement result that has been obtained, the authors can recommend some program activities to help improving their welfare. There are three dimensions, which IDZ prioritized or considered to be assisted, such as economic dimension, activity program for housewives. If Bringinsari has got an indicator as a good village and the impact is good as well, therefore, it can try to move zakat fund distribution to other villages. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study looks into the possibility of introducing M&M for underprivileged women entrepreneurs in Selangor State. Hence, it assesses clients’ willingness to accept Shariah rules, religiosity, product knowledge and entrepreneurial skills. Data from 330 respondents were collected from female Muslim members of an MFI, namely Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM). The data were analysed by using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings show that women entrepreneurs prefer those Shariah principles that seem easy to comprehend and preserve their interests. They possess primary knowledge of M&M and fairly practise intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity, but lack proper entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, application of M&M would be viable if clients’ knowledge of Shariah and M&M were improved along with their religiosity and entrepreneurial skills. These findings would help include M&M within the context of microfinancing. © 2019, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).},

	abstract = {The absence of the bottom line in not-for-profit organisations (NPO) restrains the rendering of accounts. A waqf institution is no exception. It is one of the crucial components of Islamic social finance, which eventuates in social benefits. Therefore, accountability in such faith-based institution is crucial for achieving their socio-economic impact. The relevance of waqf institutions will be examined in relation to their socio-economic impact, focusing on the impact of programs and activities using waqf funds, rather than focusing merely on expenses and outputs. This impact is particularly pertinent as, in Malaysia, waqf matters are under the jurisdiction of State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRC) in the respective region. This paper aims to develop the measurements for socio-economic impact of waqf institutions. An extensive literature review was carried out to identify the appropriate measurements for input, output, outcome, impact, effectiveness, and efficiency. The lack of performance disclosure found in this study indicates the need for comprehensive performance measurements concerning socio-economic impact. This study also conducted a benchmarking analysis to examine the presentation of performance measurement at Majlis Ugama Islam Singapora (MUIS). Reviewing their annual reports promoted the practicality of such reporting. The fact that it is similar with the mandatory disclosure on financial statements, socio-economic impact is also viewed as important since the primary focus of waqf itself is for social well-being. This study therefore proposes numerous indicators for socio-economic impact, specifically for waqf. This is to garner trust among the waqf givers (waqif), to enhance accountability and promote transparency toward sustainability of waqf institutions.. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to shed some lights on the process of mission drifting or abandoning poverty objective by Islamic microfinance institutions (IMFs). The paper investigates whether the extensive use of banking logic changes IMFs, from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts mixed methods by analyzing 7,200 microfinance data from Microfinance Exchange Market and reviewing annual reports and websites of 25 IMFs to examine their vision and mission statements and other related information. Findings: The finding shows Islamic microfinance has not changed, despite increasing adoption of financial or banking performance measures. However, size and age of the institutions may affect the outcome in the future. The authors find that smaller microfinance institutions maintain genuine objective to serve the poor, as the grow larger they would be more inclined toward sustainability objectives. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited on the sample size as data on Islamic microfinance globally is limited. However, the paper looked at the global data rather than local data to compensate for this limitation. Future study would be further taking the study through qualitative methods to support the study. Originality/value: This paper aims to shed some lights on the process of mission drifting or abandoning poverty objective by IMFIs. The paper investigates how has the extensive use of financing logic has changed IMFIs from focusing on both development and financial objectives to only considering sustainability as their primary mission. Arun and Hulme (2009) argued that the interaction of multiple logic within microfinance institutions, i.e. financial vs social, could pose some serious management dilemmas within microfinance institutions. Further, commercialization puts pressure on the field staffs to achieve financial targets and often neglect their poverty outreach mission to the poor. The well-known crisis in Andhra Pradesh, India where clients of microfinance institutions committed suicide after being shamed by field officers who tried to collect payments of loans (Mader, 2013; Taylor, 2011), provides a powerful case of the impact of financialization to microfinance clients. © 2019, Luqyan Tamanni and Mohd Hairul Azrin Haji Besar.},

Design/methodology/approach: The data set used in this study comes from four SACCOS audited financial reports from the year 2010 to 2014 and from interviews with SACCOS’s management. Findings: The study found that the IMFIs in Tanzania are not financially sustainable. Additionally, having responsible staff members, regular review of financial guidelines, education to members, cooperation between employees and management and staff training are found to be highly contributing factors towards SACCOS’s financial sustainability. Moreover, the findings reveal that depending on the single source of income, i.e., charges on members contributed much in these SACCOS’s not being financially sustainable. Research limitations/implications: Only two available registered Islamic SACCOS was used. Additionally, conventional SACCOS have been in service provision for a long time as compared to Islamic ones; hence, caution must be taken for comparison purposes. Practical implications: Based on these findings, the Islamic SACCOS needs to initiate productive projects that can enable them to have other income sources apart from charges on members. Originality/value: This study traces the financial trend of Islamic SACCOS in Tanzania since its establishment in 2010. Such trace enables Islamic SACCOS and other stakeholders to be aware on the financial progress of Islamic SACCOS and act accordingly to ensure sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The step taken by Imam Zarkasyi to modernize the education system was by integrating pesantren and madrasah system. In modernizing curriculum Imam Zarkasyi integrated the formal, non-formal and informal education utilizing pesantren environment. Students are taught not only subjects on religion and general sciences in the classroom, but also obtaining morality, mental and job skill education and other values in pesantren tradition within a well-designed informal and non-formal education. Finally, to ensure the sustainability of pesantren Imam Zarkasyi changed the status of Pesantren institution from personal ownership into public property by way Waqf.

Data are taken from national-level survey Household Integrated Income and Consumption Survey 2015–2016. Inclusion of gender dimensions of some important factors and estimation of varying estimates at four severity levels of households’ food insecurity status using partial proportional odds model may be considered unique features of the study. It is concluded that household's income, employment, agricultural income, donations, parental education level and some households’ characteristics are important factors for improving food security in Pakistan. Maternal education, and maternal paid employment compared to paternal education, and paternal paid employment show strong positive effects to improve severe food insecurity. Couple paid employment, livestock ownership and operating agricultural land seem to have the most effective role for improving food security. Social welfare programmes and religious institution of Zakat are helpful to cope with severe food insecurity in Pakistan. Some special efforts or development strategies are recommended to improve food insecurity of rural households and Baluchistan province. Moreover, the observed U-type quadratic impact of household size and the adverse impact of dependency ratio induce effective policies to control high birth rate in Pakistan. Hence, creation of employment opportunities especially for women, appreciation of couple paid employment, easy access to education for women, steps to raise level of education, growth of agricultural sector, rural development, social welfare and development schemes for Baluchistan, and continuation of Benazir Income Support Program are recommended to overcome severe and moderate level food insecurity in Pakistan. Since socioeconomic conditions and food insecurity issues of developing countries and especially in South Asian countries are homogeneous and therefore, the analysis in this study might be relevant to South Asian region. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the proposed objectives, Bait-un-Nasr (BuN) Urban Cooperative Credit Society, located in Mumbai, India, is considered for the case study. The study is based on both primary and secondary data. The primary data are collected through questionnaires and secondary data from various sources. Performance of the institution is assessed in terms of growth and sustainability indicators. Findings: It is found that BuN has been successful in providing interest-free microfinance services in India. A few operational issues have been highlighted and possible solutions are recommended. Moreover, it is found that in comparison to the microfinance industry standards, the performance of BuN has been lower. Research limitations/implications: BuN is evaluated from only growth and sustainability aspects and not from the aspect of the socio-economic impacts of its services on the lives of customers. Practical implications: This study would become a documented source of interest-free microfinance practices in India. Moreover, the recommendations provided, if implemented, would help BuN in further growth and development. Social implications: This study would help create awareness in the society about the practices of interest-free microfinance. Originality/value: This paper highlights the interest-free microfinance practices in India that have not received the needed attention.

	abstract = {Despite the importance of microfinancing as a tool for alleviating poverty, formal financial institutions, such as banks, are reluctant to provide this type of financing. There is, therefore, a need to provide financing indirectly through linkage programs. Launched by Bank Indonesia on January 9, 2004, the linkage program is the first pillar of the Indonesian Banking Architecture, and serves as a comprehensive framework for the development of the Indonesian banking industry. The program provides financing through cooperatives to their members operating microbusinesses. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of linkage pro-grams provided by Islamic banks for microfinancing through Islamic cooperatives known as houses of charity (baitul maal wa tamwil, BMT). This research was conducted by using a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative information was collected using in-depth interviews with the management and author-ized officers from five BMTs that are knowledgeable about such cooperatives. The quantitative research was conducted by analyzing the cooperatives’ financial statements and conducting a direct survey of the recipients of financing. The effectiveness of a microfinancing program is commonly measured by three aspects, known as the “the triangle of microfinance.” These aspects are the extent to which the financing provides for the poor (outreach), whether it increases the income or assets of the target population (impact), and the business sur-vival of institutions managing the financing (institution sustainability). We found that linkage programs had a positive impact, especially on improving the affordability of outreach in small and medium-sized but not in the large BMTs. We suggest that the Indonesian Bank or Indonesian Financial Service Authority should specifically encourage medium-sized cooperatives or BMTs to employ this program by providing more incentives for banks or reducing the barriers for BMTs to participate. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {Poverty alleviation initiatives by conventional mechanisms often keep the contribution of Islamic mechanisms in the shadows. This study will shed light on the ability of an Islamic Charitable Institution in contributing toward the economic growth in Malaysia through an endowment mechanism grounded on Waqf philosophy. Theory of Well-Being is incorporated with the Maslahah (Maslahah) principle of Maqasid al- Shari'ah (Maqāsid al-Shaī'ah) to elaborate the importance of Islamic Charitable Institutions (ICIs) in a South Asian country. This study first focuses on determining the long-run and short-run equilibrium relationships between donation and economic development using Unit Root model. Then, the causality between donation and economic indicators are measured using OLS regression and Granger causality test. Data for annual donation is collected from the financial reports of Lembaga Amanah Kolej Islam Malaya (LAKIM) for the year 2000 to 2013 while economic development is measured through GDP data provided by World Bank. Donations distributed by LAKIM for the enhancement of higher education in Malaysia are found to have a significantly long and short-run effect on economic growth. While OLS regression has proved the significant positive impact of donation on GDP, Granger causality test proved that GDP Granger causes donations. Management of LAKIM will be able to understand their role in the economic development of Malaysia which might influence them to become more involved through various innovative schemes to benefit the Maslahah. The study has included a time series that is limited to only fourteen years, and thus the volatility of donations could not be measured through ARCH family models. This study is the first to explore the ability of LAKHVf in contributing to the Maslahah through economic development of a developing country using econometric models that are backed by the Theory of Well-Being and Maqasid al- Shari'ah. © 2018 Islamic Cultural Centre.All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Islam guides us in poverty alleviation based on the principles of justice and equitable distribution of wealth. Islam provides practical guidelines for economic problems through both market and non-market mechanisms. Islamic finance provides a model that identifies individual differences among people not only from the perspective of equitable opportunities for all but also from providing other means for addressing economic problems. This presentation takes a deep dive into "Waqf" as a rewarding economic system. I present an alternative view of Waqf integrating it as a component of the traditional economic system. I explain how Waqf increases aggregate consumption, expenditure, and expand national income. A cross-country review of current state of Waqf practices is included for comparative analysis. It helps to grasp a complete understanding of challenges and issues in Waqf globally. Lack of trust in Waqf managers and institutions is the key factor why, despite being the best social capital model, the practice of Waqf is relatively low in Muslim majority countries. Evidence is there that in many cases financial greed takes over the financial objective creating a fear of permanent loss among the endowers. Moreover, investments of Waqf fund are not well diversified and not invested properly to generate income to support waqf assets. To get the most out of Waqf asset, strategic alignments of Waqf funds and stakeholders are necessary at the institutional level. In the final section of this presentation, I suggest a comprehensive legal framework that adequately addresses major financial, agency, and governance issues pertaining to Waqf. A Waqf friendly legal environment coupled with preferential tax treatment for the endowed funds is crucial in achieving the intended goal of Islamic finance through Waqf as its vehicle. © 2018, Islamic Bank Training and Research Academy.},

It is interesting to study the implementation of economic justice through waqf and how its regulation in Indonesia. This article employed normative juridical method. Based on the Article 22 of the Law Number 41 of 2004 on Waqf, the purpose of waqf is not solely for the purpose of ritual. It can also be used to realize economic prosperity. Based on these provisions, waqf can be managed for the economic empowerment of the people. This is related to the efforts of the improvement of the economic welfare of the people, especially for the weak economic class. According to Islamic teachings, distributive justice is economic justice based on the Holy Quran, Chapter al-Hasyr (59): 7. Waqf has the potential to create the economic balance of society. Because the principle of ownership, according to Islam, regulates that individuals or certain community members are not the only party who control the management of assets. The weak economic class also have the right. It is to avoid economic inequality. Thus, waqf is a solution to actualize economic justice in order to realize public welfare, which is one of Indonesia’s national goals as stated in the Preamble of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, Padjadjaran University.

In spite of many poverty alleviation policies and interventions of the past three decades, millions of Nigerians still live in abject poverty, while thousands of university graduates roam the streets looking for jobs. Many unemployed Nigerians with good business ideas are usually discouraged by the alarmingly high interest rate charged on start-up capitals by local banks. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve its objective, this paper used both analytical and qualitative methods after thoroughly examining many relevant literature and empirical works. The study explores four Sharī’ah tools for the implementation of the proposed scheme, to wit: musharakah, mudharabah, zakat and waqf. Findings: The study finds that the suggested Sharī’ah tools are viable and sustainable in lunching microfinance projects in the Nigerian context. The paper further argues that exploring Islamic non-interest microfinance options will guarantee the financial inclusion of a large percentage of Nigerians, pursuant to the Constitutional provision on economic rights of the entire citizenry (s.16 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended).

The results showed that social solidarity during Ramadan was high (3.32) with values of the spirit of togetherness (3.37), collective consciousness (3.32) and cooperation (3.28). In addition, philanthropy was included in a high category (3.27) with different values of alms (3.49), infaq (3.23) and waqf (3.10). Therefore, it can be concluded that Ramadan contributes positively to the social solidarity of Muslim communities in Indonesia. The result can be used to develop a model of social solidarity in overcoming the problem of disintegration. Furthermore, it improves Muslim philanthropy for social welfare and to overcome the problem of poverty. Contribution: This article contributes to the sustainable development goal of poverty alleviation.

In fact, Law No. 41 of 2004 concerning Waqf also regulates assets other than immovable property. One of these assets is Intellectual Property Rights. The economic potential of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) becomes an opportunity to realize prosperity for the community. This paper identifies IPR regimes that can be used as waqf and constraints in their implementation. The results show that the regulation of entire IPR Law allows the rights transfer through waqf with several adjustments, i.e., the term of the Copyright waqf must be adjusted to the period of copyright protection in Indonesia. In addition, the transfer of rights in the copyright waqf only covers Economic Rights. This means that Moral Rights are still attached to waqif. Constraints to the implementation of IPR waqf include the absence of legal rules at the technical level as a direction to waqif and Nazhir to carry out the transfer of rights. Another obstacle found was the absence of the role of Indonesian Waqf Board (BWI) in improving Nazhir's competence regarding Intellectual Property Rights. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The productive waqf is considered as a key instrument for providing funds to actualizing its educational program. Since both productive waqf and pesantren emphasize sustainability, and since productive waqf can assist to support the process of education in pesantren, the study aims to investigate an integrated Islamic social and commercial economy model applicable in pesantren. This will ensure utilization of the combined resources of productive waqf and pesantren in promoting pesantren welfare. The study focuses on 263 operational chief, assatidz or teacher, musyrif, musyrifah or santri companion and santri or students in Pesantren in Java and Sumatra using. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) adopted to examine the relationship among the five constructs i.e., productive waqf, business unit, project financing, human resource and pesantren welfare. While the reliability and validity are established, the structural relationship between the constructs reveals that the integrated model has a strong relationship with the pesantren welfare in many ways. In relation with business unit and profitable commercial activities, human resources have its significant role to assist pesantren tries its level best to realize developed productive waqf. Specifically, the result shows all five constructs have significant impact in promoting pesantren welfare, which suggests that the model as well as the instrument should be further implemented in pesantren. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

It aims to provide a blueprint for harnessing zakat and waqf as alternatives to remedy these social ills. The paper is a qualitative research project, performed through analysis of literature regarding current confusion points pertaining to the areas of infaq, sadaqah, zakat, cash waqf, corporate waqf, and traditional waqf. An ideal social safety net is attainable by focusing on poverty, giving special attention to economic empowerment programs. Zakat should play a supporting role in abating hunger for people in the transition while counterbalancing inequalities created by market imperfections. Since zakat funds cannot be used for social infrastructure development, traditional waqf should fulfil these needs among vulnerable people. Additionally, contemporary forms of cash waqf and corporate waqf are essential in mobilizing resources for social infrastructure development. In contrast to existing literature, this paper provides an alternative blueprint for Islamic social investment and transfer, clearly delineating the roles of infaq, sadaqah, zakat, and waqf. Different Islamic social investment and transfer tools should function like prongs, each acting in a separate sphere, working to serve the same ultimate purpose. ©The Authors.},

On the other hand, one of the zakat objectives is helping mustahik (zakat recipients) in the economic sphere. They received zakat because of limitations in the necessity of life, both in short and long period. This research aimed to explore how zakat funds improve their welfare, particularly in the sub-district of Jepara, which consists of fourteen villages. The observation and interview technics utilized for information assembly, then analyzed by Milnes and Huberman model. The results indicated that BAZNAS (Badan Amil Zakat Nasional), as a national zakat board empowered ZIS (zakat, infaq, and shodaqoh) funds through four models. The first, the consumptive model aimed to help mustahik fulfill the needs in a short period, such as giving compensation to the poor and orphans. The second, the creative consumptive model, that gave direct assistance such as medical expenses, wheelchairs, and house renovation. The third, the traditional productive model that gave productive goods to whom has certain skills, such as sewing machines for a sewing expert and goats for a livestock expert. The fourth, the creative production model, which invested some of the ZIS funds to develop health clinics in collaboration with the Islamic University in Jepara. The results also obtained that ZIS fundraising is too small, furthermore, BAZNAS should increase creativity, innovation and notice that the presence of a companion team was important to support the success of empowerment program. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Previous researches on IMFI sustainability generally viewed the financial and social or the spiritual aspect as segregated elements. There is hardly any empirical investigation that integrated these three aspects in an effort to achieve sustainability. Thus, this research is expected to fill the gap by proposing a holistic approach for achieving IMFI sustainability. This study used survey method on 98 units of sharia cooperatives/Baitul Maal Wattamwil (BMTs) using a structured questionnaires based on Likert scale of 5 points. The previous holistic approach was developed based on the literature review and the responses of IMFI's experts. Partial least square path modeling has been adopted to examine the relationship among the constructs. The results show that financial, social and spiritual intermediation has a positively significant effect on IMFI's sustainability in Indonesia. These results also show that IMFI's sustainability problem can be overcome by applying holistic approach. The study is focused on Islamic Micro Finance Institution (IMFI). The future study is expected to observe the impact of this holistic approach on the lives of the poor and on the performance of micro-enterprises as beneficiaries of IMFI. This study is the first empirical one to examine the sustainability of IMFI using a holistic approach. It also provides new contribution to the IMFI's intermediary concept from the double bottom line-as known so far-has become a triple mission of IMFI. © 2018 Allied Academies.},

The result reveals that zakat management in Baznas Pekanbaru is not effective yet in its effort to improve mustahiq (zakat receivers) economy. Of all effective strategies to collect the funds are: 1) government total intervention in collecting and distributing the zakat funds, 2) socialization to the community to pay zakat via Baznas, 3) Improving Baznas’ human resources and management, 4) Implementing the expansion concept in zakat obligation. Meanwhile, the effective strategy in zakat funds distribution is classifying mustahiq into two groups i.e. mustahiq jabariah and mustahiq khiyariah with different model approach. © 2020, Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang.

At the same time, it does not preclude the use of modern tools and techniques in raising the state revenues. Islam provides its own comprehensive approach how the state can raise its revenue and how the revenue should be spend. Zakat is collected from those who are qualified and distributed to the eight recipients as identified in the Quran. Waqf instrument plays an important role in Muslim societies as its support the aged, the poor, the orphans through provision of education, training and business activities. The creation of waqf is strongly advocated, especially the creation of cash waqf in view of the expensiveness of land as waqf. There are collaboration efforts for cash waqf and zakat collection being done through Islamic banks and takaful. The paper aims to discuss these issues.

The findings indicate that essences of governance are observable in both entities. However, huge potential for improvement still remains. Exploiting the different operational setup provides indications of measured responses and indirectly suggests the benefits of running waqf operations on a corporatized platform.

	abstract = {It is inconceivable to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the national level without accomplishing them locally. In the Arab region, municipalities face challenges to meet a widening gap between expenses and revenues. Securing a locally based sustainable financing model is of paramount importance. Wāqf is a value-based funding model that can offer new opportunities for sustainable financing to achieve SDGs locally. It agrees with Islamic law with the intent to promote social cohesion. The paper examines whether Wāqf, as a financing modality, is a Social Innovation (SI) model and its potential to finance development at the local level. The research method applied in this paper is qualitative. The authors compiled over 50 published articles, books, and reports covering the Wāqf and SI. The paper attempts to establish and explain linkages between Wāqf and both SI and SDGs. Content analysis using qualitative data analysis software is the research technique the researchers applied. The paper argues that Wāqf is an SI model. It can fund municipal initiatives that contribute to achieving SDGs. Results reveal linkages between Wāqf and SI and show that they contribute to sustainable development in human settlements. Besides, they both play a decisive role in fostering social equity, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Wāqf is a value-based financing model that satisfies the conditions and attributes of SI. Wāqf is an instrumental tool for financing development and supporting the attainment of SDGs in cities and municipalities. To harness the potential of Wāqf as an enabler for SDGs, organizational and business model innovation are needed to ensure transparency, accountability, and organizational learning. © 2019, Arabian Gulf University.

	abstract = {The article describes the latest developments of Islamic charities and their role as major non-state actors in Indonesia's field of social welfare. It considers debates about the practices of Islamic charity in colonial and post-colonial times when zakat (obligatory almsgiving) was conceptualized as social welfare and as a tool for social justice or as an instrument to implement the post-colonial state's development goals. We examine the contemporary popularity of sedekah (voluntary almsgiving) among Indonesian middle-class Muslims and the rise of Islamic charities that specialize in sedekah programmes. These charities use social media to document their activities and to raise funds, and have changed the discourse of almsgiving. We argue that the temporal logic of acceleration increasingly informs the field of social welfare in Indonesia today. Islamic charities display their efficiency, transparency, and the material rewards that sedekah practices bring to donors. Today, Islamic charity is no longer primarily associated with social welfare and social justice but increasingly with economic gain. Accordingly, charities are concerned with accelerating their aid and its mediation, emphasizing immediacy in order to appeal to donors who demand a quick, unbureaucratic conversion of donations into concrete help, and an immediate material and spiritual return on their ‘investment’. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

It has served as an effective method to improve financial inclusion by increasing the access to finance to specific groups of the society who are often being marginalized by the mainstream finance, especially women micro-entrepreneurs and the poor. Despite this, microfinance continues to face various issues and challenges that hinder its effective functioning, resulting in many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to operate at sub-optimal level, thus fail to achieve their objectives. This study attempts to discern the issues and challenges facing the Islamic MFIs by focusing on the experience of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM), one of the world’s largest Islamic MFIs, and subsequently propose possible solutions to address those issues. In methodology, the study conducts a survey questionnaire regarding potential issues and challenges of Islamic microfinance on 402 women micro-entrepreneurs who are currently clients of several AIM centres in Hulu Selangor. In efforts to get enriching insights, we further relate those issues with the demographic profile of the clients. Findings of this study provide new insights into the issues and challenges facing the women micro-entrepreneurs based on their direct experiences, and consequently relevant suggestions can be provided in addressing these issues facing the clients of the Islamic microfinance industry. © International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).},

These hospitals have managed to incorporate and integrate waqf with the public goods such as to provide good healthcare services to the Muslim Ummah in their era. This study however, have not found in-depth investigation of past waqf hospitals and documentations to show how their significance, standards and criteria which have managed to successfully evolve and integrate the Islamic culture with the changing of civilization through time. This study examines the macro-level theory pertaining to past waqf-based hospitals in the 8t h-14t h CE, and applies the grounded theory approach, analysis from the historical-comparative (H-C) and triangulation (Neuman 2014) from a qualitative perspective. In determining the themes and detecting important critical terms crucial for this study, open coding was performed on the data collected using the application NVivo 12. The general finding shows that the exclusive elements of the guiding principles of Nour, architectural and urbanism features, decentralization, al-Mizan, governance of the Mutawalli and the financial sustainability found, exist in tandem as fundamental elements for the criteria of past waqf-based hospitals whilst defining each other in their own representations. This study suggests that, the application of the medieval/classical epistemology should be a basis for a current and future developments especially in the application of waqf with a public service organization, healthcare services in particular. © 2020 Islamic Cultural Centre.

However, whether zakat is effective in improving indicators of both quantity and quality of poverty is still a question requiring empirical investigation. This study is aims to empirically investigate the role of impactful zakat in poverty alleviation as indicated by the BAZNAS prosperity index (Indeks Kesejahteraan BAZNAS or IKB), at provincial level in Indonesia. This study covers annual data from 28 provinces in Indonesia for the years 2017 and 2018. Data analysis uses a panel-data approach, with three indicators of poverty – the poverty headcount ratio (P0), poverty gap index (P1), and poverty severity index (P2) – as dependent variables. The study finds that higher BAZNAS IKB, used as a sign of impactful zakat, significantly reduces P0 but has insignificant effect on P1 and P2. The results of this study imply that zakat managers should put emphasis on the poorest section of the poor population to enable improvements in poverty indicators through zakat utilization. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

This study focused on three forms of philanthropic zakat assistance: economic empowerment, health care, and tuition-free education. There were 21 participants—seven from each respective cluster. Interviewers were employed to elicit participants’ perspectives. Major findings showed economic empowerment recipients were the poor affected by the earthquake and the monetary crisis. Zakat helped them re-open their businesses. As they grew, most felt satisfied and employed jobless individuals. Recipients of health care with elementary education had a five-year grant of free health care and health education. Although the service lowered their expenses, some needed extra help with food. Participants benefitting from either program reported positive impacts on their income, health, and social lives. Most participants in the tuition-free education were satisfied with their children's schooling, the extracurricular options, and the chances for parental involvement in the social engagement. Some stated the charitable schools emphasized moral education over science; thus, they were concerned about sufficient preparation for future competitive educational levels. Recipients would benefit from the charities if three programs were altogether offered.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on Shariah-based microfinance products in the context of sustainable poverty alleviation approach and provide them financial benefits to enhance their livelihoods. Design/methodology/approach: Here, this qualitative study critically analyzes the basics of the sustainable Islamic microfinance to exterminate the level of poverty. Findings: Islamic microfinance is a more ethical practice than the traditional motives of profit maximization, and it encourages extending the time of repayment if the debtors are in hardship. In some case, it suggests to give charity if the creditor has capability. Research limitations/implications: Most importantly, research scholars and experts have already criticized the concept of conventional microfinance on the basis of various points, especially for its high rate of interest. Social implications: Islamic microfinance is provided with a view to fulfill two tools simultaneously, i.e., social and financial inclusion. In this case, credits and Zakah can be given to the extreme poor people for satisfying basic needs. In terms of social responsibility, Islam encourages the people to be soft in case of collecting the lending money. Originality/value: The study discoursed that sustainable Islamic Microfinance (IM) may be a promising future option to draw the attention of the religiously sensitive people toward the Shariah-based microfinance which can, in turn, mitigate the poverty level. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The central focus of the Islamic economic system is on socioeconomic justice and the overall welfare of society, especially at the bottom of the pyramid segment. Qard-al-Hassan, alongside zakat and sadaqah, is one of the instruments for the redistribution of income and wealth from the rich to the poor in Islam. In 2007, Bangladesh was struck by super cyclone SIDR, leaving 3,406 people dead. Moreover, SIDR caused unprecedented damage to homes, crops and livelihoods. The Fael Khair Waqf (FKW) Program came as a response to the urgent need to assist the victims of the cyclone and initiated an interest-free micro-loan (Qard-al-Hassan) scheme to restore the livelihoods of a large segment of the victims and to lift them out of poverty. While investigating the effectiveness of Qard-al-Hassan in poverty reduction, this paper also examines the FKW program as a case study. Analysis was conducted of 1600 households using an independent sample t-test and logistic regression to investigate to what extent the program has been effective in reducing poverty. The findings of the logistic analysis are that the probability of being poor for FKW participants is around 1.46 times lower than for non-participants. Moreover, the Qard-al-Hassan of FKW lowers the cost of borrowing significantly and hence participants can accumulate more assets, which might help them to improve their economic status. Overall, the effectiveness of the program implies that development practitioners and researchers should promote the outreach of Qard-al-Hassan so that the extreme poor can easily avail themselves of the services. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

	abstract = {Waqf (Islamic endowment) is considered one of the alternative solutions to environmental problems in Indonesia. One of the examples is through the establishment of a waqf forest, a conservation initiative in the form of developing forests on waqf land. The development of waqf forests needs to pay attention to the legal side in accordance with the laws and regulations of Indonesia. Previous studies discussed the process of legalizing waqf land in Indonesia, but research about the legalization of waqf forest land is still scarce. This study aims to determine the process of legalizing waqf forests on the basis of Indonesian laws and regulations. On the basis of the results of literature studies and expert interviews that were analyzed descriptively, the process of legalizing waqf forest is one of the main tasks of a nazir (waqf manager). The process involves at least three government agencies: the Ministry of Religion, the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning (National Land Agency), and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The waqf forest legalization process begins with making a waqf pledge deed at the local Office of Religious Affairs, followed by creating a waqf land certificate at the local Land Offices. A crucial step is to clarify that the represented land must be located outside the forest area through a statement from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The legalization of waqf forests will guarantee the sustainability of the forest because this process makes waqf forest legal under Islamic law and the law of the Republic of Indonesia. © 2020, University of Indonesia Faculty of Law.

Design/methodology/approach: The study mainly applied the commonly used Tuckman and Chang’s (1991) model to measure the financial health of non-profits. Content and ratio analysis of the 2014 audited reports of seven institutions were used to determine their equity balance, revenue concentration, administrative costs and operating margin ratios. Findings: The results indicate that only one waqf institution was financially sustainable in all the four components. Research limitations/implications: Because the data used are not the latest and focussed only on a single year, the findings may not be necessarily true, currently. Second, the study focussed only on Malaysia. Thus, the results may not be generalisable to other waqfs in other countries or to privately managed waqf institutions. Accordingly, future research should address these limitations. Practical implications: The findings provide useful insights into the financial sustainability of waqf institutions and highlight the need for policymakers in Malaysia and other Muslim countries to give due attention to the holistic accountability of waqf institutions to ensure waqf’s systematic revival. Originality/value: The paper, being the first to investigate the financial sustainability and vulnerability of state waqf institutions in Malaysia, serves as a reference for future researchers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We are aware that conventional microfinance products have flourished in India; however, these products do not fulfil the needs of all Muslim clients. Taking small glimpses of Islamic microfinance (IMF), we can say it is working successfully in Muslim countries. From the meta-analysis we classify the literature into seven categories, viz. social benefits, religious values, business enterprises, poverty alleviation, sustainable development, rural development and economic development. The contribution of research papers has risen across the literature review and there has been a sharp rise in new facts pertaining to Islamic microfinance in India. As a diagnostic check, all seven factors of the meta-analysis of IMF contain evidence for the case study of India. Bait-un-Nasr is an urban co-operative credit society, located in Mumbai, India that has practised all of the factors extracted by the meta-analysis. This paper provides a roster of emerging projects accompanied by a comprehensive review of literature that will be useful to both academicians and practitioners for studying existing research and contemporary future research. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

	abstract = {Indonesia can still be classified as a developing country and has a relatively high number of poor people. Poor people account for approximately 30 million out of a population of 250 million people in Indonesia. Decisions by local officials as well as the behaviour of the community can be influenced by empowering zakat and zakat management systems in an efficient manner. The problems addressed by this writing are as follows: What is the potential of collecting development funds for poverty alleviation through zakat? What is the role of local governments in empowering people in the field of zakat management? and What is the strategic model for using the law as a means of social engineering in the field of zakat management? This problem will be solved using a qualitative socio-legal research approach. Banyumas Regency is the area of study, as it has a poverty alleviation program through BAZDA. Based on the results of the study, each region has the potential to extract development funds with different degrees of success. To enhance understanding, this study conducted a questionnaire survey that dealt with the various indicators of poverty and how zakat management dynamics can influence them. Results of this study indicates that an efficient zakat management system is centralized, distributed, and delegated. Such systems lead to good outcomes for poverty dynamics, like inability to drive to work and increased dependence on foreign aids. Additionally, centralized zakat management dynamics are also contributing to the lowering of substandard living conditions and poor medical treatment among community members. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

Islamic MFIs, which follow Shariah principles in their operations, aim not only to provide financing, but also to improve the socioeconomic conditions of poor people. There is heightened interest in the factors influencing the development of MFIs, such as relationship lending. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of such lending and the uniqueness of the implementation of social purpose in Islamic MFIs. The paper adopts a quantitative methodology, using cross-sectional survey data from 1,001 microloan borrowers from five MFIs, three of which are Islamic MFIs which provided financing in 13 regions in Indonesia in 2018. The results show that Islamic MFIs do not differ in the implementation of relationship lending. Furthermore, there is a likelihood that they are able to be more focused on profit-oriented transactions ensuring sustainability, due to their unique characteristics, as they have Baitul Maal with the social instruments of zakat, infaq and sadaqa to provide social-oriented transactions to improve outreach to the poor. The study enhances our understanding and adds knowledge to the existing literature on Islamic MFIs, especially in Indonesia. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

We also compare the relationship between shariah-compliant firms (SCFs) and non-shariah-compliant firms(NSCF). To control for possible issues of unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity and autocorrelation, we use the system generalized method of moments approach. We found that disclosure of sustainability performance increases a firm’s financial performance. Firms which disclose information on their sustainability practices were found to have higher earnings on assets and equity, which clearly supports the argument of information asymmetry. In the comparison of shariah-compliant and non-shariah-compliant firms, it was found that SCFs are at an advantage by being shariah compliant and that disclosure of sustainability performance increases the financial performance of such firms, whereas for non-shariah-compliant firms, the impact was found to be negative. One of the main findings from the research is that while firms’ involvement in corporate sustainability activities is encouraged, they also need to disclose any related information to their stakeholders, general public to capitalise on this investment, in return for a good reputation and consider going shariah complaint. Our study further recommends that the management of firms in Indonesia should focus on shariah compliance and consider sustainability-practice and sustainability-performance disclosures with a positive mindset, recognising them as means of gaining an advantage rather than as an obligation. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

	abstract = {Islamic micro-finance, despite being a small part of the Islamic finance industry, plays a significant role in poverty alleviation and financial inclusion activities. One of the key challenges facing Islamic micro-finance institutions (IMFIs) is the lack of measures of performance, which hinders the process of evaluating IMFIs’ performance and the dynamic growth of the micro-financing sector. Unlike the conventional financial sector, there have been few attempts to measure the performance of IMFIs. The knowledge of measures and determinants of success factors for IMFIs is limited and compounded by a lack of theoretical basis underpinning research in this area. This paper focuses on examining the performance measures of micro-financing institutions in Islamic micro-financing. The determination of IMFI success factors would assist in the external evaluation and internal improvements of IMFIs, which would contribute to a more dynamic micro-finance industry. Therefore, IMFIs should be evaluated not only on output and the outcome measures of both social and financial performance, but also the process and with a view of the entire value chain of financing, along with the internal process of fostering borrower cooperation to enable the achievement of well-being. © 2020.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze data from 489 owner and nonowner executives of 150 family SMEs using PLS-SEM (Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling). Findings: The authors found evidence that family involvement in business positively impacts the sustainable survival of family SMEs while corporate social responsibility partially mediates this relationship. Apart from effective family involvement in business, active involvement in social causes enhances a firm's ability to survive longer. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted in a geographic context and data were collected from family-managed and controlled firms. Further research is needed to generalize the findings to all types of family firms in the global context. In an Islamic society, family firms need to invest in social causes, human development, and environmental sustainability through zakat, sadaqat, and donations. Practical implications: The findings imply that family firms require stakeholder-centric competitive strategies and socially responsible behavior along with effective family control, commitment, enrichment, and successful succession since the path to sustainable survival goes through CSR. Originality/value: Survival is the biggest challenge facing family SMEs forcing them to achieve the ability to sustain longer. Rooted in transaction cost economics (TCE) theory of the family firm and stakeholder theory, this paper validates an integrative model for family SMEs' sustainable survival. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the philanthropic model, this study posits that firms undertaking zakat and charity are ethical firms. Zakat disclosure index (ZDI) and charity disclosure index (CDI) were constructed to measure ethical values. This study hypothesises that ethical values are positively associated with bank performance. Ethical values (i.e. CDI and ZDI) and financial performance data (i.e. return on assets) were collected from the disclosures made in the annual reports of 50 banks for a period of five years (2010-2014). Findings: A positive association was found between zakat disclosure and bank performance. The results indicate that higher zakat disclosure is associated with greater bank performance. However, no relationship was found between charity disclosure and bank performance. Research limitations/implications: Considering the limitation of the index used in this study, other dimensions such as corporate governance, sustainability, products and environment can be considered in the development of index to measure ethical values in future studies.

However, women are the main beneficiaries of Baitul Maal Wat Tamwil (BMT), Indonesia’s first IMFIs. This paper aims to explore the origins, the initiators, and the visions of BMTs and the extent to which they intersect with women’s empowerment. Employing a qualitative approach, this study selected four BMTs in Yogyakarta as a case study. It found that four critical groups that have a significant role in the development of Indonesian BMTs: ICMI (Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectual), Islamic mass organizations, NGOs, and local governments. The issues of loan sharks and poverty alleviation were the primary factors driving the inception of BMTs. Despite women being crucial clients, none of the studied BMTs explicitly invoked women’s empowerment in their organizational vision. To conclude, the BMTs’ preference for women is not based on an understanding of gender inequality, but rather motivated by pragmatic business considerations, particularly the self-sustainability paradigm that underpins their practices. © 2020, MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a multi-stage sampling technique. The primary data are collected through a face-to-face survey of 389 women respondents who have received IMFS from the Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited. Cronbach’s alpha test is conducted to test the reliability and internal consistency of collected data. Paired-sample tests, logit regression and proportion hypothesis tests are conducted to measure the impact of IMFS on women’s empowerment. Descriptive and inferential statistics are used to interpret the data. Findings: The study reveals that IMFS have led to structural transformation in the occupation dynamics of the respondents’ families from agriculture to retail businesses. IMFS have had a significant positive impact on household income, savings and expenditure; have improved standard of living and human capital formation; and have enhanced all three dimensions of empowerment, namely, economic empowerment (ECEM), socio-cultural empowerment (SCEM) and familial empowerment (FLEM). Of them, ECEM and SCEM have positively contributed toward overall women’s empowerment, while FLEM has a negative but insignificant impact on overall empowerment. The respondents’ perception also supports the finding that IMFS have benefited rural women and empowered them. Originality/value: The study is based on primary data. It leads to an inquiry as to whether women are dominant in familial affairs. If so, it may reduce the state of happiness and overall women’s empowerment. There is a clear gap in the existing literature about this inquiry. © 2020, Md. Saiful Islam.},

	abstract = {This present research studies the ideologization practices of the Islamic philanthropy institution managed by the civil society in Indonesia—a case study of Suryakarta Beramal Foundation. A qualitative method with a case study approach was employed. Data were collected using in-depth interviews, observations and documentation techniques and then inductively analyzed. The results show that Suryakarta Beramal is a philanthropy institution ideologically affiliated with the Tarbiyah movement. Most of the collected Islamic philanthropy funds zakat, (alms-giving), infaq, sadaqah (donation), and wakaf (religious endowment) were provided to finance the educational institution possessed by Suryakarta Beramal, except for poverty alleviation. The educational institution also functions as an ideologization medium. Ideologization was conducted through curriculum engineering, holding various events such as smart recharging, liqa’, mabit, rihlah and halaqah and students’ habituation, starting from using uniforms for religious activities either at school or in the dormitory. The result of the ideologization is that the alumni of the school of Suryakarta Beramal became the loyalists of the Tarbiyah ideology and are affiliated with Partai Adil Makmur (PAM) (Just and Affluent Party) as the political wing of the Tarbiyah movement in Indonesia. Penelitian ini mengkaji praktik ideologisasi lembaga filantropi Islam yang dikelola oleh masyarakat sipil di Indonesia — studi kasus Yayasan Suryakarta Beramal. Metode kualitatif dengan pendekatan studi kasus digunakan. Pengumpulan data dilakukan dengan wawancara mendalam, observasi dan teknik dokumentasi kemudian dianalisis secara induktif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa Suryakarta Beramal merupakan lembaga filantropi yang secara ideologis berafiliasi dengan gerakan Tarbiyah. Sebagian besar dana zakat, sedekah, infaq, sadaqah (sedekah), dan wakaf (wakaf) yang terkumpul sebagian besar digunakan untuk membiayai lembaga pendidikan yang dimiliki oleh Suryakarta Beramal, kecuali untuk pengentasan kemiskinan. Institusi pendidikan juga berfungsi sebagai media ideologisasi. Ideologisasi dilakukan melalui rekayasa kurikulum dengan mengadakan berbagai acara seperti smart recharging, liqa ’, mabit, rihlah dan alaqah serta pembiasaan siswa, mulai dari penggunaan seragam untuk kegiatan keagamaan baik di sekolah maupun di asrama. Akibat dari ideologisasi tersebut adalah alumni sekolah Suryakarta Beramal menjadi loyalis ideologi Tarbiyah dan berafiliasi dengan Partai Adil Makmur (PAM) sebagai sayap politik gerakan Tarbiyah di Indonesia. © 2020.

	abstract = {From the end of World War Two, the core methodology of law and development projects has been to transplant the best legal institutions of Western capitalism to poor and emerging economies. In many post-colonial contemporary Muslim-majority countries, such programs have not adequately engaged with local legal systems, cultures and traditions. Contrary to the restrictive modernist approach to law and development, and inspired by the Sharia, there are numerous Islamic social finance mechanisms that can be utilised for poverty alleviation and their existence is evident across Bangladesh. These cover the full spectrum of philanthropic to financing, investments and insurance built upon Sharia norms and principles. Unfortunately, the true potential of Islamic social finance is considerably constrained by the weak regulatory and policy environment. Islamic social finance does not feature in national development plans, is regulated through a patchwork framework, and operates at a negligible scale. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the existing regulatory and institutional landscape of Zakah (obligatory almsgiving), awqaf (perpetual endowments), Islamic microfinance and microtakaful (microinsurance) in Bangladesh and examines the potential and challenges for Islamic social finance to reduce poverty. Thereafter, several pertinent policy and institutional recommendations are provided to effectively modernise and advance the effectiveness of Islamic social finance institutions. The methodology employed is a mixed approach incorporating literature review, legal analysis of laws and regulation and contextual analysis and field interviews among industry stakeholders. Ultimately, while private investment and initiatives are always able to support the Islamic social finance sector, this paper focuses on the extent to which the regulatory and policy environment is a crucial enabler for widespread and sustained development impact. © 2020 Law and Development Review.},

Moreover, social influence (peer-pressure) is influential on the financial decision-making process. The authors also examined the moderation effect of gender on these relations and found that females, in comparison to males, tend to be more influenced by religious leader’s endorsement and social influence.

The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to examine these relationships over the period from 2010 to 2018. Overall, the study found that the zakāt distribution contributes significantly to social welfare through education at a significance level of 5% and contributes inadequately through income level at 10% level of significance. This indicates that the current zakāt distribution system in Selangor provides only a marginal influence on increasing the income of the poor. Furthermore, the zakāt distribution was statistically insignificant to social welfare through healthcare. These findings suggest that the current distribution channels of health are insufficient to improve social welfare and should be improved by offering social health insurance policy for zakāt beneficiaries. This can be done via ratification insurance plan between zakāt agencies and insurance companies to cover the basic health needs for zakāt recipients. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

The research method comes from previous studies to compare the capitalist, socialist, and sharia economic systems. In response to various economic uncertainties, both internal and external, the ability to seize opportunities and transform has become the key to economic resilience. Islamic economics can be an alternative in responding to the dynamics of the global and national economy. Several things need to be taken into consideration in fulfilling the sharia economy and the primary strategy chosen must come from the inputs given by the stakeholders, including business actors, associations, regulators as well as experts, and academicians. The primary strategy in implementing the sharia economy also requires the support of various parties in order to develop sustainability. Strengthening regulation and governance is one of the fundamental factors. Optimization of the sharia economy based social sector such as Zakat, Infaq, Sadaqah, and Waqaf can be optimized both for collection and distribution so that the concept of sharing can certainly support the development and the economy both nationally and globally. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

However, presently the waqf properties are passing through a trend characterized by usurpation, neglect and unproductive use. Prof Khalid Rashid in his lead paper has rightly emphasized need to protect and develop the existing awqaf and to consider certain measures which may enhance the income generation capability and administrative well-being of awqaf. Thus, a reform of the waqf system in the contemporary Islamic world is absolutely necessary. In a post-economic and financial liberalization environment at the global level, it is important to utilize awqaf for poverty reduction, capacity building and economic empowerment of Muslim communities. The waqf fund can be channeled through educational, social and cultural development. In this context, this paper discusses that in modern times, the economic dimensions of waqf institution need attention of scholars and economists to explore its potential role in economic life of Muslims. In a country like India waqf institutions have been playing a very significant role and have still great potentiality to do so in the religious, social and economic life of Muslims. However, they need to be cleansed of corruption and mismanagement. The control by government organization and the state interference sometimes pose another problem in the way of proper utilization of the awqaf properties in an effective way. © 2018, JKAU: Islamic Econ.},

Our findings are based on articles published in selected Islamic finance specialized journals for six years (2012-2017). Classification is based on multiple factors including subject/specialization areas, country of origin and publications, research methodology, and yearly progress in investigations. Findings suggest that the majority of publications are in the area of general Islamic finance and follow qualitative research methodology. Malaysia and Pakistan were found to be the most significant contributors to the literature. Although the results of empirical studies are mixed, however, the majority favor resilience of IFSI to the global financial crisis (GFC). The potential role of IFSI in poverty alleviation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) has also been highlighted. Demand for IFSI with quality services exists. The literature highlights the lack of Islamic financial literacy and skepticism about Shariah compliance in practice. Need for regulatory framework and application of Islamic accounting is documented. Future research needs to focus on an objective assessment of IFSI in the light of Islamic finance objectives. Also, further investigations are needed to highlight the social role of IFSI-with a focus on CSR, zakah, waqf and microfinance. Additionally, certain specialized areas including accounting, management, and corporate governance need more attention in future researches. © 2020.},

While some conclude that there is a U-shaped relationship between financial development and energy intensity, others show a linear relationship between the two variables. This study investigates the relationship between financial development and energy intensity by focusing on the role of Islamic financial development. It covers 30 countries where Islamic banks are present. Using the fixed-effects panel model, the empirical results suggest that Islamic banking development significantly increases energy intensity in the sample countries. We also identify other important factors that increase it. These include carbon emissions, renewable energy use and energy imports. The findings point to the importance of designing policies to incentivise Islamic banks and Shari’ah-compliant investors to finance clean energy technologies as a potent tool for reducing energy intensity, achieving sustainable development, and greening Islamic finance. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

One approach to improving this was the establishment of microfinance, which has since become an important part of poverty alleviation strategies, but very few studies have considered its benefits based on characteristics other than poverty. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and determine how different client characteristics affect the way people benefit from the financing provided by microfinance institutions. Data were gathered from the beneficiaries of both conventional and Islamic microfinance using a questionnaire, and then analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann–Whitney U tests. The results show how MFI financing benefits clients differently based on certain characteristics, as well as how these socioeconomic benefits differ based on whether the financing is provided by a conventional or an Islamic MFI. Overall, conventional and Islamic MFIs have similar strategies when it comes to providing socio-economic benefits to their clients. However, where they diverge is when client gender is considered, as IMFIs are more likely to benefit women. This research will be beneficial to MFIs in terms of the development of their services, as it will help them identify the strengths and weaknesses of their offerings and how well these are able to assist them in fulfilling their purpose of providing benefit to the poorest of the poor, increasing financial inclusion and contributing to socio-economic development. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Islamic MFIs, which adhere to Sharia's prohibition of riba (usually interpreted as a ban on interest), present an alternative. Differences between conventional and Islamic MFIs in terms of outreach and financial sustainability remain underexplored; no comprehensive data set details Islamic MFIs either. With new data, collected with a global survey, the authors construct a unique panel of 543 conventional and 101 Islamic MFIs, operating in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. These data suggest that the market for Islamic microfinance is more important than previously recognized, has grown in recent years, and is likely to continue growing in every region of the world. Statistical comparisons, using various estimation techniques, regarding the outreach and financial performance of Islamic and conventional MFIs also reveal that the breadth and depth of Islamic MFIs exceed those of conventional MFIs, though conventional MFIs achieve stronger financial performance.

Design/methodology/approach: This research uses quantitative methods with a measurement model of Sustainability Livelihood Impact Assessment (SLIA). Findings: The results showed that the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program had quite an impact on the increase in Mustahik Community Assets. This is seen from the increase in 5 (five) SLIA assets with a variant value of 1.09 points. The highest increase occurred in Social Assets with a variant value of 1.25. Meanwhile, the lowest increase was in Natural Assets with a variant value of 0.93 points. For Financial Assets, there was an increase in changes with a variant value of 1.19, which shows the high impact of the Tanah Datar Animal Husbandry program on increasing the income of mustahik families. This increase was influenced by the sale of organic fertilizer and compost processed from goat manure. The aspect of vulnerability that can affect the Tanah Datar Livestock Center is a fairly high outbreak of livestock disease which results in the death of the mother and child during childbirth. Originality/value: Originality / value: The authenticity of this study is to assess the impact of zakat on the beneficiary's mustahik.

Contrarily, PLWHA encounter social discrimination and adverse realities while finding it difficult to continue in their jobs. These complex phenomena interact to push them into a low economic status. A microfinance program can hopefully assist poor patients to cope with the negative economic consequences of this disease. But the conventional market-oriented microfinance institutions show reluctance to serve this group of people due to the possibilities of having credit risk. In this paper, we propose an alternative microfinancing technique that can provide a better economic life of the PLWHA while absorbing the credit risks. A comprehensive model is designed using specific Islamic financial instruments in conjugation with household economic portfolio theory. Critical realism method was adopted to construct this model. We concluded that the application of Islamic microfinance can enhance income of HIV patients while reducing the productivity-loss. This model can be useful to the microfinance practitioners and policymakers for addressing a different market segment, diversifying products, and formulating policy. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Baitul Maal wa Tamwil (BMT) is an Islamic microfinance institution created by combining the functionality of Baitul Maal and Baitul Tamwil in Indonesia. While Baitul Maal plays the role of an institution that collects funds from zakah, cash waqf, infaq and sadakah, Baitul Tamwil then distributes these funds in the form of Qardhul Hassan financing to the poor at the bottom of the economic pyramid (BOP). This study aims to explain the poverty alleviation effort by BMT regarding its role in providing Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP and provide practical suggestions to maximize the outreach performance of the BMT. Design/methodology/approach: In this methodology, the study adopts the qualitative analysis of reviewing the literature and interviewing the BMT staff in Jakarta, Makassar and Nusa Tenggara Barat areas to present the views of the practitioners related to the role of Baitul Maal in giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP using appreciative intelligence framework. Findings: The study finds that BMT in Indonesia needs several stage-specific structures and roles to be effective. In particular, there is a need to separate the function of Baitul Maal from Baitul Tamwil to enhance its role when giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP. The role of Baitul Maal in alleviating the poverty figure is also drawn in this study. Originality/value: The findings of this study add to the literature on Baitul Maal by enabling researchers and practitioners to appreciate the role of Baitul Maal, and these findings also contribute towards enriching the knowledge in Baitul Maal and financing requirements of the poor at the BOP. This paper also contributes to the field of Islamic accounting which is currently getting prominent. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Critics concerning the real impact of traditional microfinance as a tool for poverty alleviation are becoming frequent. In contrast, the financial crisis brought out interest for Islamic finance, whose models have been increasingly studied. Today, the real challenge lies in evaluating the impact of microfinance in a complex environment, where both Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions exist and address evolving clients in constant interaction. New methods and models are therefore needed in order to test the efficacy and assess the impact of introducing Islamic microfinance products, compared to the conventional system. In this context, this paper proposes an approach to build an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) framework, which is aiming to test the effects of such products implementation using Islamic interest-free group loans. It also helps assess the impact of the behavioral biases as well as agents' interactions within the repayment process. © 2018 Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi.},

	abstract = {This study looks at how firms react to shocks in equity prices based on a classification which arises from social pressures rather than the financial objective of maximizing shareholders' wealth. In order to meet the objective of the study, a sample of Malaysian firms from the period of 2003 to 2018 was utilized to evaluate the relationship between market and book debt ratios based on a social distinction. The study is based on the theoretical expectation that managers are inclined to adjust book debt ratios to converge with market debt values which arise from changes in equity values over time. We introduce a unique institutional setting into the relationship which is readily observable in the Malaysian capital market given the existence of Shari'ah and non-Shari'ah compliant company classifications on the stock exchange (Bursa Malaysia), as screened by the Securities Commission. The classification forms the basis for distinguishing Socially Responsible Investment options for investors. The findings reveal the existence of asymmetries in how both categories of firms adjust towards shocks in equity prices. The findings document that both compliant and non-compliant firms decrease book debt ratios in line with increases in firms' equity values. Compliant firms, on the other hand, are more likely to increase book debt ratios during periods of decreases in equity values. Non-compliant firms do not significantly alter book debt ratios during periods of declining equity prices. The findings indicate that whilst firms tend to decrease debt levels in the presence of future growth potential, the response is asymmetric during periods of suppression of share prices. Thus, the screening of compliant versus non-compliant firms allows investors to distinguish sustainable firms in the long run, which further allows diversification when holding socially responsible investment portfolios. Our conclusions have wide reaching implications on a global scale for the development of sustainable capital markets. © 2019 by the authors.},

In observing the sustainability of BMT, there has been relatively little research involving aspects of the quality of the human resources that carry out internal activities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to create a model that is useful for predicting the sustainability of IMFIs, especially BMT, based on variables that are considered important, namely financing growth, Islamic human capital, fraud and Islamic leadership. The model was analysed using multiple regression analysis based on the stepwise method. The primary data (cross-sectional) were obtained in 2019 using questionnaires completed by 105 respondents comprising the administrators and managers of BMTs in Semarang and Pekalongan, Central Java, Indonesia. We found that only two variables have a significant influence on the sustainability of IMFIs: financing growth and Islamic human capital. Practitioners can apply the results of the study to improve the performance of Islamic microfinance, especially BMT, through the distribution of funding in the context of economic improvement (especially micro-enterprise), spiritual strengthening for human resources, risk prevention and appropriate leadership criteria. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

Simultaneously, Islamic social finance and its mechanisms has continued to gain spotlights due to their viability and sustainability nature. They are not only offering chances to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but also beyond such goals. Looking into the application of waqf as one of Islamic social finance's instruments, this continuous charitable giving is preferred due to its features that are perpetual, irrevocable, and inalienable. In Thailand, reviving and sustaining waqf properties are still limited due to the lack of funds. However, with the existence of new technology called crowdfunding platform, the revival of waqf can be made possible. Such revival of waqf is essential for the society at large, especially for the Muslim community. The revival of waqf may provide essential assistance in alleviating poverty and gives an equal opportunity for economic participation. By using a qualitative research method and documentary-based legal analysis, this research looks at the opportunity of reviving waqf in Thailand through crowdfunding platforms. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

Several types of research have been done on the factors of people contributing to voluntary giving and factors of the rejection. There has been no complete study found on how to cultivate the Islamic Philanthropy, although there are eternal rewards ascertained in Islam. To fill this gap, this paper focusses on the effort of developing a Systematic Education-Professional (Edu-Pro) Model to jet-boost participation and sustainability of Islamic Philanthropy in the era of the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0). A qualitative method is used in analysing and synthesizing the relevant literature and document review to develop this model from the framework of Maqasid Shariah, together with the combination of accelerating rapid growth of the world technologies and digitalization. This theoretical study examines the Quranic verses and theories from scholars to support this model. The aspect of education will also be zoomed in to ensure that this model is developed systematically and professionally. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

Precisely, we examine whether higher corporate social responsibility disclosures firms are gratified to perform in an accountable manner to restrain earnings management practices, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. The use of the generalised method of moments estimator for a Bangladeshi sample of 270 listed banking companies for the period 2009 to 2017 investigates the association between corporate social responsibility disclosures and earnings quality proxied by discretionary accruals. Results show that managers in an emerging economy manage earnings when they provide more CSR disclosures. Furthermore, Shariah compliant banks provide more corporate social responsibility information and maintain superior financial reporting quality through constraining earnings management. The outcomes of this research are noteworthy for both policymakers and market participants. Investors need to be cautious from the point of view that businessess engage in corporate social responsibility activities, behave ethically and provide transparent financial reports. Hence, policy makers need to be vigilant about this opportunistic practice and improve observing to implement social agreement. Probably, some strategies can be introduced to settle that corporate social responsibility revelations are grounded on genuine exercise and not just a “greenwash” proclamation to mislead shareholders. © 2020.

However, provision of access and services to lower-level households can potentially conflict with the sustainability of the institutions. This study analyses the social outreach factors that determine financial and social efficiencies. To reach the set goal and solve this issue, we used mixed methodology combining quantitative (statistical instruments, such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and multivariate analysis) and qualitative approaches (interviews to clarify or deepen the existing information). The assessment of the dependent variables is influenced by proxies of depth, breadth, length, scope, and cost. The results showed that the average loan instalments and the number of offices and branches significantly influence financial and social efficiency. The age of the institution only has an effect on financial efficiency. Simultaneously, profit orientation, the amount and type of financing and the amount and type of savings only have a high impact on social efficiency, whereas the impact of fund collection and cost per borrower is insignificant. There is a strong positive correlation between the two dependent variables. The influence of independent variables on financial and social efficiency is significant with the coefficient of determination 23.1274 % and 53.2941 %, respectively. © 2020 Institute of Economics, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Several previous studies state that the Islamic Social Finance program has not fully succeeded in creating prosperity, and there are no definite measurements to show the sustainability impact of the program. Thus, a measurement is needed to analyze various aspects in achieving the success and sustainability of Islamic social finance programs. This study developed an index for performance evaluation with an emphasis on the success and sustainability of the Islamic Social Finance program. The study used the Analytical Network Process to determine and analyze priority components. Furthermore, the Multistage Weighted Index method was used to calculate the final index score. The index was built by taking into consideration various factors, stakeholders, aspects, and indicators. This study indicates that aspects of funding contribution from donors (0.22), involvement of donors in giving advice (0.99), and controlling of supervisor (0.08) are priority aspects in the success and sustainability of the program. An empirical investigation was performed on three different programs in Indonesia: A, B, and C. Program A (0.81) and C (0.80) have succeeded in improving the beneficiaries' quality of life to the level of economic resilience, although at a low level of sustainability (76-84.33). On the other hand, program B (0.73) is at the economic reinforcement and has not yet achieved sustainability. This index can be seen as a comprehensive tool for measuring the success and sustainability of the program at several levels. © 2022 Widiastuti et al.

We took in-depth interviews of three experts in Islamic finance and banking by using an open-ended questionnaire articulated with the vital issues of MM&M financing. According to experts’ opinions, relevant skills, religiosity, and product knowledge can be considered clients’ primary attributes for letting them access these financing schemes. Nevertheless, the involvement of third-party guarantors, cash waqf, and technology usage will augment the usefulness of this financing approach.

	abstract = {This paper focuses on presenting a working model by combining the concepts of Waqf and smart Sukuk that works under the contract of Ijarah. Therefore, it can be referred to as a waqf based Ijarah Smart Sukuk model. In a study conducted by Che Zuina Ismail (2015), it is found that due to several reasons such as bureaucracy and lack of transparency in waqf administration, Waqf has lost much of its dynamism. Due to these reasons and several others, many waqf properties are either lying idle or in a dilapidated condition, which has led to Awqaf's effectiveness and role being questioned. There is a need to broadly advertise the significant role played by Awqaf as an instrument of social welfare. Hence, this model is suggested for the development of waqf properties and to revive the role of Waqf in society's social well-being. By using the qualitative method, this paper also highlights the issues or challenges involved in the practical application of the smart Sukuk or Ijarah contract, including possible Shari'ah issues. The paper's policy implication suggests that the states adopt this technologically advanced and Shari'ah compliant working model to target the development-related issues of waqf properties. This paper will also offer the existing and upcoming professionals in Islamic finance a broader perspective about smart Sukuk and hopefully encourages them to develop a favourable framework for smart Sukuk and other smart contracts, which is currently lacking. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Despite the fact that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in strengthening the financial sector within developing and emerging economies through providing employment opportunities to the rural and urban population, capacity building in the form of skills training and economic empowerment, they still face a plethora of challenges that continue to threaten their existence, performance and growth. Access to operational and administrative funds needed to execute their activities effectively is a significant challenge and detrimental to the growth of SMEs in Uganda. Conversely, Islamic microfinance has been noted as a panacea to the challenges of financial inaccessibility among SMEs, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate how the adoption of Islamic microfinance can play a fundamental role in enhancing the sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) while meeting the financing challenges of SMEs in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a review of existing literature was carried out to critically examine relevant information (literature sources) and empirical studies on SMEs, their performance and challenges. The study being conceptual tries to understand how Islamic microfinance could be adopted as an alternative scheme of financing to bridge the gap and mitigate the financial challenges facing SMEs. Findings: The study finds that the existing MFIs have failed to achieve their objectives of providing financial services to the poor and SMEs while remaining sustainable. This has left the majority of SMEs within Uganda's informal sector financially handicapped, thus leading to their failure in meeting their expectations and eventually collapsing even before celebrating their third or fourth birthdays. However, the enactment into law of the Financial Institutions Amendment Act 2016 that paved the way for the introduction of Islamic finance in Uganda, and the Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions and Money Lenders' Act, 2016 that incorporated the aspects of Islamic microfinance within the existing microfinance framework as seen and is perceived as a key factor in addressing the financial challenges faced by MFIs and the SMEs if fully adopted. Research limitations/implications: This study is conceptual with no empirical investigation and discussion of key theories. On the contrary, it will be imperative and useful when carrying out more extensive hypothetical studies by future researchers, specifically in the area of Islamic microfinance that is relatively new in Uganda. Practical implications: Practically, this paper will serve as a guide to policymakers and practitioners in the field of microfinance by adding a flair that could enable in bridging the challenges associated with inadequate financing of SMEs in Uganda. Social implications: Socially, the social aspects of charity (Zakah and Sadaqah) will help to improve the livelihood of the poorest of the poor who cannot engage in active business through meeting their basic needs of life without begging thereby preventing them from being social outcasts. Originality/value: The study establishes Islamic microfinance (IMF) as a promising and unexplored viable option potentially needed in intensifying the financing needs of SMEs in Uganda. The paper provides an entirely new dimension in nature and way microfinance products should be structured with a view of ensuring that there is sustainable provision of financial services to SMEs. The paper adds real value to the existing conventional microfinance products and services in Uganda, given the ethical and moral attributes of Islamic microfinancing practices that are assumed to efficiently and effectively motivate SME owners and other small entrepreneurs to thrive. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This article aims to study Indonesia's experience in issuing Cash Waqf Linked Sukuk (CWLS), the schemes and legality which are meant for Islamic social welfare improvement, and CWLS' contribution to the national development. It is the development of a conceptual paper that explores and carefully reviews regulations, relevant literature studies, reports, and official documents published on the internet. The findings showed that Indonesia has successfully formulated and issued two instruments for integrating cash waqf with the State Sukuk: the CWLS and Retail CWLS. These instruments involve six state institutions and eight central socio- religious institutions that act as formulation, implementation, and supervision. Both instruments are not only beneficial for Islamic social welfare, but they also contribute to the national development. The authors argue that the innovation of Islamic financial instruments can empower the Islamic social welfare and contribute to the national development. It contributes to the discourse on cash waqf innovations in State Sukuk which studies Indonesia's experiences. This evidence from Indonesia can be adopted and applied by other countries that have fiscal limitations for the empowerment of Islamic social welfare, and at the same time contribute to the national development. © (2023), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah).

The package of measures adopted by the EU in this context, outlines the importance of sustainable finance strategy, aimed at financing the transition towards a sustainable economy. A tool to enable the pursuit of this transition is Green Bond. The EU Commission launched a taxonomy proposal aimed at creating Green Bonds quality standards and certifications, because the existing industry standards are still based on definitions of green projects that are not sufficiently uniform, rigorous or comprehensive. The adoption of uniform universal standards for the definition of green projects could also contribute to stop “greenwashing”(the practice of falsely attributing green qualities to an investment which in reality does not possess them). For example a recent Italian decision (Alcantara vs Miko) stated that the rules for communication on sustainability are different from those on traditional advertising because sustainability should be real and not a façade. This study examines the possibility of a uniform adoption of standards at EU level and compares the European Green Bond standards with other similar initiatives, such as the Shari’ah-compliant Green Sukuk. © 2023 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) owners’ intentions to participate in waqf, involving two countries, which are Malaysia and Indonesia, using the theory of planned behavior. SMEs are the backbone of many economies, representing 95% of all companies worldwide and accounting for 60% of employment. Based on this fact, this paper analyzes the influence of religiosity, knowledge and attitude to predict the intentions of SMEs’ owners in waqf participation in Malaysia and Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Data were randomly obtained from 175 SMEs owners from Malaysia and Indonesia with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) used for analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis data suggest that knowledge and attitude show a significant impact on the intentions of SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf, while religiosity does not have a significant impact on the intentions of Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs’ owners to participate in waqf. Practical implications: This study aims to assist SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia to formulate appropriate strategies and marketing using waqf for the sustainability of SMEs which represent more than 90% of business establishments in both countries. The strategy is a necessity, especially because the government is targeting to promote a sustainable Islamic financial system, improve governance policy and halal industry for SMEs, strengthen the development of Malay Reserve land, providing as financial independence to higher learning institutions and invest in digitalization and advanced technology through waqf funds. Therefore, both countries should take the initiative to provide training to equip SMEs with extensive knowledge through multiple platforms to further encourage their participation in waqf. Originality/value: Because of the increasing interest in waqf participation both in Malaysia and Indonesia, this study claims three essential contributions. First, it aims to examine the intention of SMEs in waqf participation among the business owners in Malaysia and Indonesia. Second, the study findings are expected to benefit the development of literature in accordance with Islamic social finance, particularly waqf. Third, this study provides an insight into the inclusive knowledge and attitude of SME owners and their intention to participate in waqf. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To further enhance this process, digital waqf has emerged as an innovative solution. This study aims to analyze and investigate the determinants of Muslims' intention to use digital waqf, employing quantitative methods. Through the distribution of online questionnaires, a total of 304 respondents, specifically individuals involved in waqf and digital waqf, were randomly selected. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. The findings reveal that perceived usefulness and attitude exert a positive and significant influence on the intention to use digital waqf. However, perceived ease of use and perceived trust do not significantly impact the intention to use digital waqf. Notably, this study uncovers that social image, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust can enhance individuals' attitudes towards digital waqf. Among all the variables examined, perceived usefulness emerges as the most significant factor contributing to the intention to use digital waqf. © 2023, Success Culture Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In developed and developing nations including Malaysia, the governments provide financial assistance such as subsidies, tax deductions and financial assistance to help the households with children. However, limited government resources as well as focusing too much on economic growth in the region have restricted the assistance it can provide to the households. Thus, there are many private and charitable sources of funding that exist especially for those in need. For Muslims, there are numerous philanthropic organizations that regularly collect various charitable funds in differ ent forms, such as Zakat, Waqf, Sadaqah, and Hibah. Waqf instrument plays an important role in Muslim societies as its support the aged, the poor, the orphans through provision of education, training and business activities. Waqf institutions have managed to provide social welfare services that many current states struggle to offer. The establishment of Waqf institutions all over the Muslim world was indeed the result of worship towards Allah. This study aims to find out the permissibility of using the Waqf fund for developing of childcare facilities and the best way of its implementation. This study employs a qualitative research methodology based on deductive method of analysis of jurisprudential and literature based-evidences. The conclusion that can be drawn from this research is; Waqf for child care is permissible and can be accomplished through Waqf’s asset integration. This study also proposes the strategies of creation Waqf for childcare facilities through the modification of Waqf fund in few ways. © 2021, CA and C Press AB. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Poverty is a crucial and worldwide phenomenon. The main purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship exists between socio-economic factors, social factors, and poverty, the relative influence of economic and social factors on poverty and to describe causality between time series in the VAR system. This study utilized the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) by using quarterly time-series data, 1994Q1 to 2018Q4, that have been collected from the world development indicators (WDI) and Economic Survey of Pakistan. The study identified education, unemployment, inflation as economic factors while zakat and rainfall as social factors that can reduce poverty. The findings of this study indicate that inflation and unemployment have a positive and significant relationship with poverty in the long run in Pakistan while education, rainfall, social welfare programs, and zakat has a negative relationship in the long run with poverty. Besides, the study also found that in the short run, there is no relationship between economic and social factors with poverty. Moreover, the study found that in the long run that the relative contribution of education and rain increases, 28% and 20%, is greater than the contribution of inflation, social welfare programs, unemployment and zakat, 3.8%, 0.5%, 2.5%, and 0.08%. Similarly, its contribution to poverty reduces up to 44% in the long run. This study helps policymakers to take important decisions about economic and social factors while designing policies to reduce poverty. The results suggest that the state bank of Pakistan should adopt a contractionary monetary policy to control inflation and policymakers can develop policies like education for all. The government should develop a business environment to create more employment opportunities. © 2021 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

This study focuses on using SimBaznas on the loyalty of zakat payments, the cand constraints, and strategies taken to increase zakat payments in the two regions. This is a mixed-method study to obtain more comprehensive, reliable, and objective data. The results showed that the implementation of SimBaznas at Baznas in NTB was only carried out on reporting zakat collection that had been carried out properly, while reports and asset reports had not been well informed in SimBaznas. Meanwhile, in Aceh Province, all SimBaznas features have not been effective. Quantitative analysis shows that the ease of use and availability of facilities and infrastructure do not guarantee a correlation with the implementation of SimBaznas in the two provinces. In addition, the seriousness of the interest of SimBaznas users has an effective effect on the implementation of the system. However, it is certain that the existence of SimBaznas has no significant effect on the loyalty of Muslims in the two provinces. The problem with using SimBaznas is caused by the lack of quantity and quality of IT-based human resources. Therefore, the strategies that can be applied are improving the quality and quantity of SimBaznas IT managers, socializing SimBaznas to the public, encouraging ratifying the law on zakat as a tax deduction, and finalizing the regulation of zakat as PAD in Aceh. Therefore, in the context of fiqh muamalah, Baitul Mal will increasingly contribute to poverty alleviation, economic development, and human resource development in NTB, Aceh, and Indonesia. © 2022 Samarah.

The population of this study is 8 sharia banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2014-2018. The result of the study showed that zakat disclosure significantly affected financial performance. Moreover, ethical values that were proxied by CSR disclosure did not significantly affect financial performance. The limitation of the study is the limited number of the sample; therefore, it is expected that the future research adds other sharia financial entities and adds the dimension of management, sustainability, product, and the environment as benchmarks of ethical values.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose a hybrid microfinance model that integrates various Islamic commercial and social finance institutions through Fintech for efficient and impactful results. The microfinance model caters to the financial and social intermediation needs through a set of financial services and non-financial support. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses both a mathematical model and an empirical estimation using micro panel data to establish the core problem in microfinance operations. Conclusions from the mathematical model and estimated results in the empirical analysis are used to suggest an institutional design which embeds technology in the delivery of Islamic microfinance in an integrated structure. For screening and incentive conditions, the study gives illustration through numerical examples. Findings: The mathematical model highlights the need for financial sustainability, outreach, scale and complementariness of non-financial factors such as commitment, repayment incentives and skills enhancement multiplier. In light of this, the proposed Islamic microfinance model is outlined to create synergies by integrating a diversity of funding sources through social savings and impact investments. The programme also blends financial services with non-financial support to ensure engagement and commitment on a long-term basis. It uses Fintech in various demand and supply-side operations to show how technology embeddedness can help in achieving cost efficiencies and extend outreach. Originality/value: It is the first study in integrated institutional design in Islamic microfinance literature that embeds Fintech in both demand side and supply side operations comprehensively. The proposed model is conducive for enhancing outreach, scale and impact in the Islamic microfinancial services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to devise policies in implementing cash waqf system of Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT) in Indonesia, enabling the BMT to optimize its commercial and social activities to better achieve outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST) method, with three groups of knowledgeable respondents, including expert, BMT practitioner and regulator to formulate important and certain policies. Findings: The results show that four types of policies are required to improve cash waqf system of BMT, including 12 internal strategic policies, 15 internal operational policies, 15 external strategic policies and 9 external operational policies, which were found to be within a “certain planning region.” All of these policies have been agreed significantly by each group of respondents, as well as by all respondents combined. The most important-certain policies include Shiddiq, Amanah and professional Nazir, inculcate Islamic values to BMT employees and members, standard operating procedure and standard operating management of cash waqf management, technical assistance for Nazir to manage cash waqf and IT systems for BMT-cash waqf administration. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative method used has its limitations, which could be improved by incorporating other methods. Moreover, the case and respondents are all Indonesian, so that the results are possibly only applicable to BMTs in Indonesia. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt these policies in implementing their cash waqf management optimally. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help improve the social activities of the Baitul Maal directly from social cash waqf and indirectly from productive cash waqf. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study using SAST method to determine policies needed by the BMT to upgrade its cash waqf management producing more social programs for the society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This research used a qualitative approach to increase financial performance and sustainability. The study population comprised the Baitut Tamwil Muhammadiyah (BTM) in Central Java Province, Indonesia. The data collection techniques included questionnaires and an in-depth interview, and the framework was validated by the main participants. Findings: This study showed that BTMs have implemented risk management using different standards. However, such risk management is carried out partially while prioritising certain risks and using different methods. The risk of Sharia compliance is the most recognised risk, while financing and operational risks are the most anticipated, because these two risk types directly impact financial performance and sustainability. In general, a risk management model can improve financial performance and sustainability. Nevertheless, there are obstacles in implementing risk management at BTMs, which include weak human resources, the employee selection process, human resource development and a good control system. Originality/value: This research explored best practices for risk management in IMFIs and may contribute to the development of risk management in such institutions to maintain the financial performance and sustainability of their services. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of Islamic social finance (ISF) instruments such as Zakah, Sadaqah and Waqf in the provision of social services by Islamic faith-based organizations (IFBOs) in Southwest Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts exploratory approach based on field interviews conducted with leaders of IFBOs, whereas purposive sampling technique was used to select three case study organizations. Data collected from interviews and documents of case study organizations was analyzed using content and narrative analyses. Findings: The first findings indicate faith in the Unseen God, scriptural texts and socio-economic factors as major motivation that accounted for the IFBOs’ concern for social services. The second finding shows that the ISF strategies used by the IFBOs to improve access to social services include Zakah, Awqaf, Sadaqah and gifts. The third finding reveals that the IFBOs have efficient stand-alone and windows operational structures that align with IFBOs corporate governance. The fourth finding also reveals the challenges facing the IFBOs such as inadequate funding, dearth of manpower, lukewarm and uncooperative attitude of Muslims and attitudinal behaviour of givers and takers. Research limitations/implications: Absence of documented directory about the role IFBOs usage of ISF in providing social services in Southwest Nigeria affected the study. Many IFBOs were eliminated during the process of selection because of lack of records to indicate their social services relevant to the study. As such, information that could have been collected from the eliminated IFBOs could have contributed significantly to the study. Practical implications: The major implications of the study are that ISF has been reinvented as an ethical social welfare framework for supporting the disadvantaged members of the society with ISF instruments and also highlighted the dichotomy existing between IFBOs in the North and Southwest Nigeria with respect to the legal and operational activities of IFBOs usage of ISF. Originality/value: This study has contributed to a better understanding of the role of ISF instruments in the provision of social services in an area that is largely under-researched in Nigeria. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The population of this research are 573 beneficiaries of zakat and 236 samples (Slovin formula). Respondents are members of the BAZNAS (Badan Amil Zakat Nasional) business group in West Java Province. The results show that all Zakat Community Development’s (ZCD) have sufficient sustainability values from an economic perspective. The Squared Correlation (RSQ) value is 91.85 percent, and therefore, it suggests that the results of the Multidimensional Scaling analysis on the Zakat Community Development from an economic perspective can be explained as very good.

The results support that the institutional contributory performance (ICP) having a positive effect, and the level of sustainable development of zakat recipients (SDZR) do increase after receiving zakat, but there are issues that need careful addressing. The study further examined the moderating role of demographic factors, such as earnings, age, marital status and gender, and witnessed that after zakat, all parameters improved, though individual moderating variables yet to show any significance.

This study examines the business growth as a mediating variable on the relationship between the impact of the zakat empowerment programs and mustahiq’s (zakat recipient) welfare. This quantitative study employs Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis on 100 mustahiqs from different zakat empowerment programs in East Java and DI Yogyakarta. Zakat empowerment positively affects mustahiq’s welfare. This indicates that the empowerment program successfully increases mustahiqs’ wellbeing and their business. Business growth as a mediating variable on the relationship between business assistantship and mustahiq welfare also shows a positive and significant effect. Further, macroeconomic indicators consisting of GRDP and inflation and internal factors consisting of age and educational level, have different impacts on the business growth of mustahiq. This study confirms the zakat empowerment program’s role in improving the mustahiq’s welfare based on maqashid al-shariah (the Islamic objectives). Zakat community empowerment is a solution to suppress the poverty rate and possible for reducing inequality and ending poverty in Indonesia. This study extends the literature by providing a unique measurement of mustahiq welfare. This study incorporates maqashid al-shariah considerations to measure the wellbeing. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The current paradigms of Islamic economics and finance lead to comprehensive sustainability performance that considers Islamic Sharia goals. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review focusing on assessing the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs) through various model measurements from a global perspective published in reputable international journals until 2023. The authors have applied several literature review techniques, including bibliometric citation and content analysis, to review past studies. The collected manuscripts comprise 52 papers published from 2008 to 2023, categorized into various research topics. The results indicate that research on sustainability performance in the Islamic finance sector is still scarce, despite experiencing a fairly fluctuating increase. The highest number of publications was in the year 2023, with a total of 11 papers (19%) out of the overall publications. The findings from our research show that existing studies have used a variety of techniques to measure the sustainability of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IMFs). The review highlights that the most frequently utilized models in measuring the sustainability of Islamic microfinance institutions use qualitative approaches. However, 37% of articles within the collection employ quantitative measurements. Previous research generally considers financial and social aspects or spiritual dimensions as separate elements.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyse the role of zakat in poverty alleviation and income inequality reduction based on the gender of zakat recipients. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the Centre of Islamic Economic and Business Studies (CIBEST) model as a poverty measure and the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index as income inequality measures to analyse 1,300 zakat recipients in five different areas of West Java, Indonesia. Findings: Based on the CIBEST model, zakat distribution programmes have better salutary effects on male-headed households in terms of material (0.215) and absolute (0.037) poverty indices, whereas female-headed households have better performance on the falah (0.438) and spiritual (0.022) poverty indices, with greater changes in these indices in female-headed households. According to the Gini coefficient and Atkinson index, female-headed households have better income distribution one-year after zakat distribution programmes, whereas the male-headed households have better performance in regards to welfare loss. Research limitations/implications: The present study only used the poverty line standard published by the Central Board of Statistics from the Republic of Indonesia to identify respondents who live under the poverty line. Practical implications: This paper can serve as a reference for zakat institutions in the implementation of zakat distribution programmes when the gender of zakat recipients is taken into consideration. Originality/value: Not many studies have analysed the impact of gender in zakat distribution programmes despite gender being one of the most important determinants of poverty and income inequality. This study attempts to determine the economic impact of zakat from the perspective of gender. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to investigate the impact of credit risk-taking on financial and social efficiency and examine the relationship between credit risk, capital structure and efficiency in the context of Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs) compared to their conventional counterparts. Design/methodology/approach: The stochastic frontier approach was used to estimate the financial and social efficiency scores, in a first step. In a second step, the impact of risk-taking on efficiency was evaluated. The authors also took into account the moderating role of capital structure in this effect using the fixed and random effects generalized least squares (GLS) with a first-order autoregressive disturbance. The used dataset covers 326 conventional MFIs and 57 Islamic MFIs in six different regions of the world over the period of 2005–2015. Findings: The overall average efficiency scores are less than 50%, where CMFIs could have produced their outputs using 48% of their actual inputs. IMFIs record the lowest financial (cost) efficiency that is equal to 28% on average. The estimation results also reveal a negative impact of nonperforming loan on financial and social efficiency. Finally, the moderating effect of leverage funding on the relationship between credit risk-taking and financial efficiency was confirmed in CMFIs. However, leverage seems to moderate the effect of risk-taking behavior on social efficiency for IMFIs. Originality/value: This paper makes an initial attempt to evaluate the effect of risk-taking decision and its implication on efficiency and MFIs' sustainability. Besides, it takes into consideration the role played by the mode of governance through the ownership structure. In addition, this research study sheds light on the importance of the financial support for the development and sustainability of these institutions, which in return, contributes to a sustainable economic development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The quality of the loan portfolio is very crucial as the loans are typically not backed by any physical collateral. Having dual roles of achieving social and financial objectives, lenders require the microfinance institutions to have long-Term financial sustainability. The study aims to gauge whether financial risks of Islamic and conventional microfinance institutions are pro-cyclical to economic conditions. The study utilises the dataset of 39 microfinance institutions for Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan from 2007 to 2013. Findings indicate that financial risks are pro-cyclical with economic conditions for both Islamic and conventional banking institutions. However, Islamic microfinance institutions are exposed to a higher financial risk during an economic downturn. This implies that Islamic microfinance institutions should improve the quality of their portfolio to preserve sustainability and resilience. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

	abstract = {In this research, we present a framework for blended Islamic finance for impactful small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs). The blend results from discussing the pertinent perspectives that underlie the motives of philanthropy, private sector activities and public sector facilitation. The consensus of these three stakeholders on the impact criteria is an essential precondition for the blend to happen. Therefore, we first developed the consensus-based impact criteria for SMEs, namely, 4Zeros & SS (zero-waste, zero-emissions, zero-interest, zero-foreclosures and service to society). After that, we adopted a financial engineering approach to design products by blending the three motives. Financial contracts could be incentive compatible and effective if these three motivations are recognized and brought together. The purpose of our research is to offer such incentive-compatible structures that can mobilize funding for impactful SMEs, save cost as well as generate revenue for self-sustainability. In the contract design, the private sector provides finance, the philanthropist pays the costs of funds, the public sector facilitates, and the impactful SME gets subsidized financing. Since the blended nature of the contract provides a social subsidy to fund the cost element of the financing, the proposed structure creates a win-win result for the blending parties. While financial institutions expand into the SMEs sector for profitability, blended Islamic finance will attract additional resources toward enhancing development impact. Through the philanthropic component, SMEs, on the other hand, will access the source of social subsidy that will relieve the burden of the exorbitant commercial rates. The funding structure will reduce risk perception and spur growth. Consequently, this collaborative and innovative contract design will contribute to achieving multidimensional human development, as enshrined in the Maqasid al-Shariah, and the SDGs. Impactful businesses must integrate environmental, social and governance best practices as well as national development goals. Hence, the proposal offers several benefits and prospects of extended use for other consensus-based purposes such as low-cost housing, solar panelling, health, education, etc.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

It uses a qualitative approach through observation, documentation and interviews with officials and those in charge of waqf from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. The data was then elaborated with expert opinions based on Herman Daly’s sustainable economic theory and John Locke’s theory of ownership and Islamic law theory (hifz al-mãl, himãyah al-bī‘ah and istiṣlãh). This study found that through the waqf system, the waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Indonesia managed to reach certain achievements, namely good education, poverty reduction, hunger alleviation, and decent work. It was found that waqf institutions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out various programs in every area of sustainable development, including providing drinking water. Another service included digging wells in areas where they were needed, which we rarely found in Indonesia. The Sustainable Waqf Law contributed to several aspects that could positively impact society and sustainable development in general. The Sustainable Waqf Law could positively impact sustainable social, economic, and environmental development. In addition, the waqf contributed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13 and 16. Finally, it is important to involve various parties, including waqf institutions, government, communities, and other stakeholders, to ensure the sustainability, transparency, and fairness in the management of waqf assets and their utilization in achieving sustainable development goals. © (), ().

	abstract = {This study proposes a novel Shariah-compliant portfolio optimization model tested on the daily historical return of 154 Shariah-compliant securities reported by the Shariah Advisory Council of Securities Commission Malaysia from 2011 to 2020. The mathematical model employs an annual rebalancing strategy subject to a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constraint while considering practical and Islamic trading concerns, including transaction costs, holding limits, and zakat payment. To validate the model, the optimal portfolios are compared against an Islamic benchmark index, a market index, and portfolios generated by the mean-variance model, as well as a forecast accuracy test by the Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Arctangent Percentage Error. Furthermore, this study examines the inter-stock relationship within the generated portfolios using correlation and Granger causality tests to identify the diversification performance. Results show an outperformance of the model in offering portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns under a comparably short computational time and an indication of generally well-diversified portfolios by the weak correlations between securities. The study further noted that the model is adept at risk management in addition to higher forecast accuracy during financial crises by showing remarkably fewer causal relationships during bear markets in 2011, 2014, and 2020. The findings of an inversed relationship between portfolio risk and the number of causalities between securities offer new insights into the effect of dynamic relationships between securities on portfolio diversification. In conclusion, the proposed model carries higher moral and social values than the conventional models while portraying high potential in enhancing the efficiency of asset allocation, contributing to economic diversification and the scarce literature on Islamic portfolio optimization modelling. The study also supports the substantially increasing demand for Shariah-compliant strategies following globalization and the changing demographic of the real financial world with growing priorities of social and sustainability values. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

It highlights the role of value-based strategy in developing a sound and resilient Islamic banking system to overcome future crises and further strengthen the impacts of Islamic banks. The study used quantitative and content analysis research methods, with data collected from the annual reports of 10 VBIBs from 2017 to 2020. The empirical results show that VBIBs have better risk-adjusted capital levels and asset quality, enabling them to be more resilient during crises. They provide more satisfactory returns compared to the VBBs and GSIBs. However, VBBs have a better asset structure and growth rate, which contributes to the real economy. The overall findings suggest that adopting value-based strategies in Islamic banking improve banks’ sustainability, resilience, and social impacts by concentrating resources on value-based activities that provide economic resiliency and enhance inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The study fills gaps in the current Islamic finance literature concerning empirical studies on value-based Islamic banking. It also helps practitioners to understand the relative efficiency, resilience, and social impact of VBIBs. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Design/methodology/approach: Panel regression models are used for this study to test the effect of ESG practices on the performance and the interaction variables to examine the impact of double ESG – Shariah screening on firms’ performance. Findings: This study finds a positive relationship between ESG practices and financial performance, suggesting that ESG practices can enhance firm value. Additionally, the authors also find evidence that double ESG–Shariah screening can enhance the ESG relationship with performance. These results are consistent and robust to three proxies for financial performance and different estimation techniques. Practical implications: The positive relationship between ESG practices and performance implies that firms should improve their ESG commitment as this is consistent with enhancing performance. Originality/value: This study presents evidence concerning the impact of ESG practices on the financial performance of Shariah companies, thereby paving the way for further studies in sustainability investments in Shariah companies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

At the same time, waqf land assets can be empowered to alleviate poverty. This study aims to: 1) optimise the utilization of waqf land assets through simulation of hydroponic cultivation and biofloc; 2) find a poverty alleviation model through the development of waqf land assets; 3) describe the implications of the implementation of the model. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative, carried out by simulation and interviews with the community. Kapanewon Sedayu and Kapanewon Banguntapan are the main focus of the study and implementation of waqf land assets, considering that Bantul Regency had the highest number of poor people in 2020, as many as 138.066 people. The results show that based on the simulation, waqf land assets allow for community empowerment and the formulation of a waqf land asset management model through the Model of Islamic Social Entrepreneurship, and there are several implications for empowering the poor. © 2022, Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously damaged the socio-economic development of Nigerians. Meanwhile, the country is in a debt crisis, which is largely attributed to the fall in the price of crude oil revenue that is used to finance its budget. This makes it difficult to provide sustainable support towards poverty alleviation in the country during the pandemic. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore various technological applications to apply in the revitalization of Islamic social finance instruments in Nigeria. Through a review of literature, the study provides various fintech applications that are essential for reviving the role of Islamic social finance instruments, particularly zakat and waqf institutions for sustainable poverty alleviation in the country. Besides, the benefits of supporting Islamic social finance instruments with technological applications were also provided for the efficient and effective administration, collections and distributions of Islamic social funds. Hence, the study recommends the adaption of the best practices found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bahrain, the U.A.E, etc. Besides, five specific recommendations have been proffered for the successful digitalization of Islamic social finance instruments in Nigeria. These recommendations can feasibly be implemented as it currently has a Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, which is saddled with the responsibility of transforming the country into a fully digital economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Nigeria’s economy is currently the largest in Africa and the world’s 26th, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US$600 billion (roughly N81 trillion) in 2017. Unfortunately, the prevalence of poverty in Nigeria is also growing. According to the World Bank estimate, poverty accounts for more than 70% of the population, implying that over 130 million people live below the poverty line. Microfinance is one of the most successful strategies for eliminating poverty since it provides access to financial resources that can assist in reducing poverty by fostering financial involvement and empowerment. Despite the fact that there are over 800 microfinance banks in Nigeria, their contribution to the country’s economy is less than one percent. In addition, the basic objective of eradicating poverty has not yet been attained. Therefore, the extant literature has projected Islamic microfinance banks as a feasible solution to alleviate poverty in Nigeria, especially by looking at many Muslims in the country. Hence, Islamic microfinance banks continue witnessing minimal or no development in Nigeria. This study examines the obstacles impeding the growth of Islamic microfinance banks and their commercial viability. It also aims to provide solutions and recommendations to assist Islamic microfinance banks in regaining the public’s trust by expanding their financial inclusion through various Islamic micro-credit products as a viable alternative to the existing conventional microfinance banks that offer high-interest loans. This study uses qualitative research techniques to fulfil its objectives. The data for this study were gathered using a semi-structured interview. The research reveals several regulatory concerns, such as licence processes and substantial paid-up capital, which is one of the most significant obstacles. Similarly, awareness, misconception, and compliance continue to be the most critical obstacles for IMFBs in Nigeria. Implications of the study for microfinance institutions, policy regulators, and recommendations have been provided in line with the main findings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This article aims to discuss the authority of the state in managing zakat, infaq, and sadaqah (ZIS), and describe the authority of the Baitul Mal in managing ZIS as locally-generated revenue (PAD) in Aceh. The study used a case study approach by using the theory of authority as an analytical tool. Data collection techniques were carried out through interviews and document studies. The informants interviewed were the staff of the Baitul Mal and the staff management of the Ulema Consultative Council (MPU) in Pidie Regency and Sabang City. It found that the state, in this case, Baitul Mal, has the authority to manage ZIS which can be treated as PAD. This practice has contributed to poverty alleviation, scholarships, business capital, and community economic empowerment in Aceh. To facilitate the management of zakat funds, lex specialis can be applied as a position of Islamic law in the national legal framework.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic impacts the zakat management of zakat institutions. Zakat is an Islamic obligation to donate a portion of one’s wealth. This is because the income of the muzakki (the people who pay the zakat) decreased. The pandemic caused the decline of people’s income, thus increasing the number of mustahik (zakat recipients). This condition encourages the application of a zakat empowerment concept that aims to accelerate people’s economy. AIM: This paper aims analyze the zakat empowerment concept in the health and welfare aspects during the pandemic, to obtain legal protection based on the benefit (maslahah) and policy theories. METHODS: This qualitative research aims to focus on the zakat empowerment concept in the aspects of health and welfare during the pandemic. RESULTS: The zakat institutions may channel the zakat to the mustahik who are affected by the pandemic in the form of medicine, COVID-19 vaccines, and capitals to families whose breadwinners lost their jobs or died due to the pandemic. This qualitative research aims to analyze the zakat empowerment concept during the pandemic in the aspects of health and welfare and its legal protection based on benefit (maslahah) theory and the policy theory. According to the policy theory, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic is according to Law No. 23 of 2011 on Zakat Management. CONCLUSION: According to the maslahah theory, it is categorized as a maslahah hajiyah from the basis of maslahah al-mursalah. However, to give legal certainty and legal protection, the zakat empowerment concept in the health and economic sectors during the pandemic should be validated in legal regulation. © 2021 Moch Chotib.},

	abstract = {The Niger State of Nigeria is one of the twelve northern states of the federation which adopts Shariah as a legal system during the fourth republic amidst several social challenges. The state emphasizes social reconstructions in its approaches to Shariah implementation and hence, establishes Zakat and Endowment Board for collection and distribution of zakat items to reconcile the society through poverty alleviation. An even distribution of wealth through zakat is hoped to reduce the rate of crime in the region. Northern Nigeria is studied because shariah is practiced only in that region, hence this paper examines the activities of the Board within the time frame of 2001-2017 which was the period of active application of the re-introduced Islamic Criminal Law in the region to identify the level at which the aims of its establishment had been achieved. The historical research method was used in carrying out this study. The authors read previous literature related to the work for background information and further interviewed stakeholders in the government and beneficiaries of the program. The result of the literature and information from the interviewee were analyzed and discussed, and the findings of the work revealed that if Muslim individuals and concerned Muslim organizations did not stand up to strengthen the institution of Zakat in Niger state in particular and in the shariah compliant states in general, the institution will be a shadow of itself. If poverty shall be alleviated through a veritable institution of zakat to reduce the rate of crime in the society, it is recommended that Formidable Islamic organizations in the state such as Jamaatu Nasrullahi-l Fātih Society of Nigeria (NASFAT) and Federation of Muslim Women Organization of Nigeria (FOMWAN) should collectively work on creating an independent zakat board. © The Author(s) (2022).},

This representation signified a shift in media coverage of Islam in the 2000s. While the mediatised acts of charity were centred on Muslim social responsibility, the article advances that the representations of Muslim charity revealed not only the significant place of Muslims in the Zambian society, evidenced by the recognition by both state and non-Muslims as key players in public life, but also their ability to unite as a religious minority.  © 2022 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine the extent of human governance and information technology usage able to act as a driving force for sustainability reporting to increase company performance by investigating shariah-compliant companies in Indonesia. A quantitative methodology from 70 Indonesian Islamic manufacturing companies registered in Indonesia's Islamic capital market has been chosen to achieve the study's objective. A descriptive and multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data using companies' annual reports for 2019. The study found that Human Governance (HG) Index was positive and significantly related to sustainability reporting and sustainability reporting to business performance. However, IT usage was found not significantly related to sustainability reporting for shariah companies in Indonesia. Further sustainability reporting is also a significant mediating 'variable for HG to business performance, but not for IT usage. This study contributes to the discussion of Islamic governance, human resource, and usage of IT. The findings can be used to identify the necessary mechanisms that should be enhanced to strengthen the practice of business performance. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose and verify the suitability and applicability of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the State of Libya. The proposed models combine the unique features of social solidarity, cooperation “Ta’awan,” meeting religious requirements and providing financing more fairly and equitably. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is applied in this study through semi-structured interviews with several Libyan experts, including Islamic bankers, Shariah scholars, MSMEs experts, Islamic microfinance experts and academicians. The data collected from 2019 to 2021 and thematic analysis by computer-based software NVivo is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results indicate that the proposed Islamic equity-based microfinance models are suitable and applicable in Libya. This study also reveals that the proposed models have numerous potential benefits not only in meeting the financial needs of MSMEs but also in meeting the government objectives in economic divarication and socioeconomic development. Research limitations/implications: First, the study proposes the applicability and suitability of Islamic equity-based models in financing MSMEs only, while large firms are excluded from the study. Second, the study only proposes and tests the applicability of Islamic equity-modes of financing contracts, namely, Musharakah and Mudarabah, while Islamic debt-based financing models are not included. Finally, as there is no practical evidence of using those models for financing MSMEs in Libya, this study lacks empirical evaluations of equity models’ real benefits on income, employment generation, living standards improvement and business growth and sustainability. Practical implications: Given the importance of the MSMEs sector for the State of Libya’s economic growth, it is expected that the findings of this study can be of assistance in formulating guidelines and implementing Islamic equity-based microfinance programs. Besides, it can be a valuable source of information for policymakers for improving the functions of the current microfinance programs in the country. Additionally, as studies concerning Islamic alternative models for financing MSMEs are scarce, the current study can also be a reference point for researchers, academicians, practitioners and other stakeholders. Social implications: Providing capital support for the underfunded economy segment, attracting small savings, increasing investments and developing entrepreneurial skills could lead to improved economic productivity and growth. Originality/value: The present study proposes the structure of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for MSMEs in Libya and verifies the suitability of those proposed models among Libyan experts. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has been conducted on uncovering and exploring the potentials of Islamic equity-based microfinance models for financing MSMEs in Libya. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The research method used is quantitative. The sampling technique uses a purposive sampling technique. The number of respondents was 156. This study showed that the product knowledge variable had no significant direct effect on the intention of contributing to the endowment of money through salary deductions. Islamic Religiosity is having a substantial impact on the plan to add to the donation of money through salary deductions due to the amount of t-test 2.2303> 1.96. Consumer Attitude significantly affects the intention to contribute to the money endowment through salary deductions because the t-test value is 2.7174> 1.96. Trust greatly influences the aim to add to the donation of money through salary deductions because the t-test value is 3.2647> 1.96. The intention significantly affects the behavior of contributing to Waqf money through salary deductions because of the t-test value of 13.8070> 1.96. Based on the study's results, respondents are willing to make Waqf money through salary cuts. If this can realize, it undoubtedly encourages the acceptance of Waqf money, which in the end, Waqf will further contribute to community economic empowerment (Maukuf Alaih). Related to that, we need a role model first to make further policy steps. © University of Tehran.},

While the fintech has already made its mark, there has been somewhat limited use of shari'ah-compliant fintech (such as P2P lending, crowdfunding, wealthtech, e-wallets) by Muslim microentrepreneurs (MEs) in Malaysia. Hence, this study examines the factors that affect shari'ah-compliant fintech usage and its effect on income sustainability via an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). One hundred sixty-five (165) questionnaires were distributed to Muslim MEs who are users of shari'ah-compliant fintech. This study reveals that performance expectancy and facilitating conditions have positive and significant effects on the use of shari'ah-compliant fintech. The extended relationship of shari'ahcompliant fintech adoption and income sustainability also presents a significant and positive relationship in which shari'ah-compliant fintech has the potential to increase and, more importantly, sustain MEs' income level. © 2022 ournal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper used a constructive method that used the 3 C (communication, coordination and cooperation) model to develop a framework. This included initial assessment of the current usage of ICT in zakat management and the expectation of collaborative zakat management through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. A focus group discussion was conducted to validate the model. Findings: ICT is currently used for the administration of zakat management, providing zakat online services and reporting zakat to the public; ICT is not used for collaboration. The proposed collaboration using the 3 C model consists of communication, coordination and cooperation. The focus group discussion validates the proposed ICT-based collaboration framework as an effective strategy for increasing zakat management. Practical implications: The results highlight strengthening institutional capacity and decreasing overlaps in zakat collection, distribution and empowerment. Zakat institutions need to restructure and reconstruct business processes based on ICT collaboration, and government must provide regulations and ICT infrastructure. Social implications: The results increase equity and capacity in zakat distribution and empowerment, therefore it can improve poverty alleviation. Originality/value: The potential and usage of ICT for collaboration among zakat management organisations have not been thoroughly explored.

Using a systematic method to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature, this study highlights how IMFIs play their role in alleviating poverty in Indonesia. Seven databases of Emerald Management, Science Direct, Google Scholar (English keywords), Google Scholar (Indonesian keywords), ProQuest, Scopus, and Academic Search Complete were used to gather articles published from early January 2016 to the end of 2020. From the data collected, it is found that the number of published articles with the theme “Islamic Microfinance Institutions and poverty alleviation” decreased beginning in 2019, with most of the research consisting of case studies in West Java using qualitative research methods. The impact felt by the community through the implementation of these programmes includes increasing societal welfare and reducing the number of poor micro and small entrepreneurs. This perceived influence has economic, social, and spiritual benefits that can help Indonesia’s economic and social growth. This review is expected to contribute to the evidence supporting poverty alleviation through Islamic microfinance in Indonesia.

This program is initiated to respond the grave condition of water scarcity as the OIC countries only share 13.3% of the world renewable water due to the desertification, water mismanagement and inadequate water infrastructures. As practical guidelines, the OIC Water Vision employs Islamic values as follow: (1) Shura (consultation and participation); (2) Ijtihad (the seeking and sharing of knowledge); (3) avoiding Fassad (to not causing harm and equitable use), (4) Zakat (sharing of wealth with the poor), and (5) Waqf (the use of donated endowment funds). By using international collaboration as a theoretical framework, this article aims to depict the OIC’s vision of water sustainability; while qualitative method provides a valuable approach to examine both empirical and interpretative data related to the OIC Water Vision programs.

	abstract = {Technology innovation affects both the public and private non-financial sectors, the zakat institution (Islamic social finance) included. The institution uses an online system to communicate with zakat payers and zakat recipients to ensure its effectiveness in terms of collection and distribution. This research focuses on the adoption of a technique known as AD/AC and ZP/ZR, which is mainly utilized by partially and non-privatized State zakat institutions in Malaysia. To this end, three (3) techniques pertaining to appraising the performance of Malaysia’s Zakat institutions in managing Zakat funds were established. The analysis also includes the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the performance of zakat collection of the respective zakat institutions in Malaysia. In this relation, a quantitative approach was adopted using the primary and secondary data collected from JAWHAR and various states’ zakat institutions. By utilizing a technique of online data collection and applying the AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR methods, the performance of Malaysia’s zakat institutions is appraised. Furthermore, with the help two (2) ratios and eight (8) scenarios the performance of the innovative technique of AD/AC and ZP/ZR for zakat collection and disbursement, efficiency and sustainability of zakat institutions in Malaysia were evaluated. The results show that most zakat institutions, particularly those that deal with zakat payments, have begun to use the technique AD/AC and ZP/ZR within their organizations. The performance of zakat institutions in all states in terms of zakat distribution and disbursement do not have a consistent trend for the period 2016-2020. However, there is still a dearth of technology being used for zakat disbursements and fund reporting. From the observed data, with 2016 being the exception, for each remaining year, a state in Malaysia is ranked as the best technology performer or the most efficient. Selangor - fully privatized state (2017), Pulau Pinang - fully privatized state (2018), Federal Territory - partially privatized state (2019) and Negeri Sembilan-partially privatized state (2020) are the most efficient for the respective year. The sustainability of each zakat institution in Malaysia in the presence of Covid-19 pandemic was ascertained as well. Interestingly, contrary to the efficiency result, all non-privatized states (Kedah, Sabah and Kelantan) and one partially privatized state (Negeri Sembilan) were sustainable in coping with Covid-19 pandemic, while all fully privatized states (Selangor and Pulau Pinang) were not. Overall, it was conjectured that the technique AD/AC as well as ZP/ZR would help to improve the operations of zakat institutions to become more efficient and successful in distributing zakat fund to the poor. However, as zakat collecting and distribution involved millions of records, its management is still debatable by all parties. © Authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: The problem of poverty requires a social innovation-based assistance strategy that involves various parties or collaboration in solving a social problem. Poverty alleviation policies are not only centered on bureaucratic aspects but are also always human-centered (human-centered design) in defining and formulating innovative policies. This research aims to identify stakeholders in social innovation in order to overcome the impacts of poverty. Theoretical framework: This research uses 6 dimensions of social innovation in analyzing the impact of poverty in Indonesia. Apart from that, this research also explains the role of stakeholders through the Quintuple Helix concept where there is a continuous balance between government and society. Method: This research is a type of qualitative research with 50 research informants who refer to five requirements for selecting informants. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with social practitioners so that researchers could get more concrete information about the problems that occurred. Results and conclusions: In the Social Exclusion Dynamics dimension, it was found that the Indonesian Government's policies were able to provide accelerated handling that was not trapped in bureaucratic, techno-technical aspects. By making the community work partners or volunteers who are socially active. The Mobilization of Resources dimension is related to the synergy aspect of multi-stakeholder involvement which is able to provide community capacity development, mastery and understanding of technological information so that it can improve the quality of life. In the Satisfaction of Human Needs dimension, pragmatism in the government system often causes a loss of innovation and creativity in exploring local resources in society. In the context of health service policy, it is often not possible to explore the source of the main problems in society. The dimension of empowerment is the creation of knowledge. Knowledge is data and information combined with ability, intuition, experience, ideas, and motivation from competent sources. In the dimension of Change in Social Relations, social innovation is ultimately able to determine permanent changes in the social environment, power, relations between social groups, government, and society, the state and the private sector. These dynamics are related to those displayed in the triangle of vision, intention, development culture, identity, organizational and institutional dynamics. Meanwhile, in the Territorial Specificity dimension, the research results show that funding for poverty alleviation activities is assisted by CSR programs from industry as well as social assistance from various elements of society, such as institutions, individuals, companies, zakat institutions, foundations, volunteers and others. Research implications: This research has implications for the involvement of stakeholders in social innovation in overcoming the impacts of poverty Originality/value: The value of this research lies in the application of the social innovation dimension through the role of multi-stakeholders in overcoming the impacts of poverty. The research results also provide new value to the role of organic intellectuals which refers to actors who play an important role in society. © 2023 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {Waqf (Islamic endowment) has received great attention from contemporary scholars, in line with the increasing attention being paid to social welfare. However, it is conceptually unclear, with no consensus having been reached among researchers on its current status. This study provides a brief overview of recent Waqf research developments, hence paving the way for future research. The research employs a bibliometric approach to analysing and summarising the trends and status quo in Waqf growth. Only articles written in English extracted from both the Web of Science and Scopus databases were considered for the study. The paper is an attempt to establish a solid conceptual base and to suggest directions for future research. The research provides a clear picture of the growth of Waqf, and indicates research gaps by reaching comprehensive conclusions about what has been achieved in the field. It hence opens new doors for scholars to develop innovative Waqf models to bridge socioeconomic issues. Our findings show that Indonesian and Malaysian scholars and their educational institutions have had a robust research commitment to the theme of Waqf during the last forty years. However, there is a lack of research on the countries where Waqf was first practised. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

This study aims to determine the distribution model and use of productive zakat and to determine the effectiveness of productive zakat in improving welfare after natural disasters in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative methods with the theoretical development of field research. Data collection was carried out through interviews and in-depth observations from national zakat management organizations in Indonesia, including The National Board of Zakat of Republic Indonesia (BAZNAS), The Department of Amil Zakat, Infaq and Alms of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU-Care LAZISNU) The Department of Amil Zakat, Infaq and Alms Muhammadiyah (LAZISMU), as well as communities receiving productive zakat programs. The results of this study indicate that the model of productive zakat distribution by zakat institutions in Indonesia uses two approaches, namely through direct business capital assistance and through proposals addressed to victims of natural disasters. They use zakat for starting businesses or developing businesses that are already owned by the recipient of productive zakat funds. In sum, productive zakat helps the economy of people who receive productive zakat recipients but it is still not effective for their welfare. Therefore, to increase the maximum role of zakat institutions in distributing productive zakat, synergies are needed between zakat institutions, partners (universities, volunteers, business consultants, etc.), and Islamic insurance. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The microfinance industry has contributed significantly to sustainable socioeconomic growth. In spite of its remarkable significance, microfinance still faces some obstacles in the industry. A significant challenge is its poor performance in terms of business growth due to lack of integrative approaches and creative resources. In response to this issue, a collaboration between Waqf and Microfinance is proposed to develop socioeconomic growth for sustainability. However, the element of urgency as an intangible resource is needed to ensure the collaboration practice will perform well and significantly contribute towards sustainable socioeconomic growth. Thus, this study aims to examine the impact of urgency on the performance of Waqf-Microfinance project collaborations. To contextualize sustainability within the collaborative practice, this study has evaluated the mediating influence of sustainability in terms of the relationship between urgency and the performance of Waqf-Microfinance collaborative projects. Subsequently, the advance partial least square technique (PLS) was employed as the primary approach to assessing the research model of the study. A quantitative approach was employed in this study. Industry practitioners are encouraged to adopt this research framework in developing a model that can provides a comprehensive guideline on the importance of urgency to enhance the performance of waqf- microfinance collaboration. © Estudios de Economia Aplicada 2021.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the potential of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance (zakat, waqf and Islamic microfinance) to alleviate poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic with the moderating effect of ethical orientation. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected through the administration of paper-based and electronic questionnaires to 400 respondents out of which only 277 were found valid for analysis. Findings: The study showed that by direct relationship, the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance instruments have a potentially significant positive contribution to poverty alleviation during the COVID-19 pandemic except for zakat that has an insignificant positive contribution. Ethical oriental has also a significant positive contribution. Contrary to expectation, the moderating effect of ethical orientation has changed zakat and waqf to have significant negative and insignificant positive contributions, respectively. Only Islamic microfinance has endured the moderating effect to continue contributing significantly and positively to the reduction of poverty. Research limitations/implications: The study explored only the potential impact of the awareness and knowledge of Islamic social finance to mitigate the extreme poverty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Practical implications: This study clearly showed the need to create enabling laws and policies to support the operations of zakat and waqf institutions to achieve their objectives effectively and efficiently. These two institutions should be integrated with Islamic microfinance for the possibility of getting better outcomes. Social implications: There should be massive campaigns to restore religious, social and political ethics to enhance the socio-economic development of Nigerians based on the principles of brotherhood. Originality/value: This study provides unexpected and unusual results showing the inability of zakat and waqf institutions to alleviate poverty due to poor ethical orientation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Waqf has historically been a vital institution in Islam in fulfilling religious needs and improving social welfare. Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Public trust and contributions are also low due to the opacity of the accounting and accountability system. Scholars have proposed adopting the blockchain technology to mitigate these issues. The implementation of the blockchain technology is to provide a solution for waqf organisations towards offering transparency to their donors and building trust to gain more support towards the waqf organisation’s mission and work. The blockchain technology manages information within the waqf system by enhancing the aspects of transparency and reliability in how funds are collected, managed, and distributed. This study has two objectives: first, to look into the technological role of blockchain in managing waqf assets in ensuring the most efficient way of financing waqf projects. Second, this research is aimed at exploring and understanding the blockchain technology regarding the issues of trust and accountability in waqf organisations in Malaysia. The study methods consisted of content analysis and an interview. The content analysis focused on publicly accessible information online such as home pages, websites, user interface pages, and annual and financial reports. The semi-structured interview was carried out with a representative of a waqf organisation who has extensive knowledge of these technologies. This article is an effort to contribute to the body of knowledge by exploring blockchain technology’s potential applications and their limits. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Rumah Zakat is one of the largest socials (non-profit) organizations in Indonesia that has implemented a work culture transformation that has been implemented since 2017. Because of the importance of transforming work culture at Rumah Zakat, it is necessary to evaluate the implementation of work culture. However, the evaluation is still not maximally carried out in implementing the application of work culture with the 360 Degree Feedback assessment concept because there is no system or application that can support the implementation of the assessment of the application of work culture in real time (online) and can directly process the data of the assessment results and provide decision results from the implementation of the application. work culture. Therefore, an application or decision support system for evaluating the application of employee work culture at Rumah Zakat was built using a web-based Multifactor Evaluation Process (MFEP) method to facilitate the process of evaluating the application of employee work culture objectively with the concept of 360 Degree Feedback based on weights and assessment indicators that have been assessed. determined based on each employee rank.

Design/methodology/approach: A Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) approach has been used in this study, which was conducted over 1,600 households including 1,200 program households in 40 villages and 400 control households in 20 villages of 8 districts in the south-western region of Bangladesh. Findings: It is found that 38.5% of sample population was multidimensional poor with deprivation of above the cutoff score. However, FKW participants were relatively less multidimensional poor. It was 35.3%. Hence, it is argued that the FKW is an effective program in terms of poverty reduction as it has contributed to higher economic outcomes for their participating households. The econometric result also suggests that the likelihood of the participants of FKW to be MPI poor is around 1.5 times lower than the nonparticipants, and the result is significant at 1% level. This indicates that program has a positive impact in reducing multidimensional poverty. Practical implications: The analysis in this paper would fill the literature gap by investigating the link between application of QH and poverty alleviation. It will also guide academicians, researchers and decision-makers to design evidence-based policy to alleviate poverty. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been no empirical work in Bangladesh on the effectiveness of QH in poverty reduction considering an MPI approach.

	abstract = {In a community in Indonesia, the proposal of establishing a mosque as the activity center has increasingly bloomed. This program restores the exuberance of the mosque through religious practices and places it as the center of community life in social, cultural, and economic aspects. In Palangka Raya, several mosques played an economic role in building bazaars around mosques, including bistros and other small businesses. Given that most of the mosques in the city have obtained large amounts of infaq (almsgiving) and waqf, it is essential to know the extent to which these funds are used in improving the economy of Muslims, especially in Palangka Raya and its surrounding area. The researchers used qualitative research by extracting primary data through interviews, observations, and documentation. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of empowerment of infaq and waqf in the mosques of Palangka Raya City in the maqasid al-sharia perspective. This study argued that the problems in the economic empowerment plan for mosques in Palangka Raya were the lack of human resources (HR), socialization, and funds. Therefore, to minimize the drawbacks, mosque management should continue to improve its quality by socializing mosque programs, providing training for new mosque cadres, and offering professional development for existing human resources on managing zakat, infaq, and sadaqah to maximize the mosque income. © 2021 Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of financial performance measures on the social norms and values of an Islamic microfinance institution (IMFI), and the actions taken by the organisational members to maintain these values in their organisation. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study of an NGO-based IMFI in Malaysia was undertaken, with interviews conducted with officers and managers at various organisational levels of the IMFI. Insights gained from institutional work and institutional logic were used to theorise the findings. Findings: The IMFI used mainly financial measures to manage its performance, which were interlinked with the commercialisation approach in the industry, and the top management’s focus on the financial sustainability of the organisation. The lack of social goals and the use of reward-based financial measures did not weaken the solidified social values at the operational level, due to the independence of the operational units, the compartmentalisation of profit-making activities and the institutional work of the operational managers. The operational managers acted as carriers of this social logic. Religious values formed the pillar of the permanence of social values in the IMFI. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the internal practices of IMFIs, and the role of religious values in the permanence of social logic in the context of an NGO-based IMFI. The lack of measurable social goals, as well as their rewards, does not compromise the focus on poverty alleviation and community development in view of the intrinsic rewards and accountability of the operational managers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to highlight the importance of waqf in financing higher educational institutions (HEIs) and its potential as an alternative source of generating additional funds for the HEIs, and discourses on waqf practice, fundraising, waqf management and utilisation of waqf income for the development of higher education in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the information gathered through interviews with 12 participants who are actively engaged in waqf in different capacities. The participants can easily be classified into three expert groups; personnel of waqf-based universities, personnel of the respective State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs) and waqf practitioners. In addition, archival records, relevant documents and library sources have been used in the research. Findings: The study learnt that waqf in Malaysia is centralised and exclusively controlled by the SIRCs, which are, as a rule, sole trustees of all categories of awqaf in the respective states; hence, any form of private trusteeship is considered illegal. It is a prerequisite for the establishment of a waqf fund to obtain permission from the respective SIRCs, and bring it under the purview of the council prior to setting up a waqf. The ministry of higher education has taken some initiatives to encourage HEIs to use waqf as an alternative source of generating funds. Subsequently, numerous public universities have set up waqf funds and developed a comprehensive mechanism for raising the fund through traditional and modern methods and technologies. A major chunk of the waqf funds is collected in the form of cash, but the amount falls short of reaching critical mass to enable the waqf to become self-sustaining. The study found that the universities also involved themselves in various social welfare programmes, especially in health care, and some income-generating projects besides seeking support from the waqf fund for their academic and educational activities. Practical implications: The paper brings out the fact that waqf offers the best features as an alternative fiscal instrument to finance projects of public good, including higher education at three selected waqf-based universities in Malaysia. Social implications: The study’s findings will be helpful to the ummah in general and Malaysia in particular. It can help policymakers, legislators and academicians in formulating new strategies for the common good and sensitize the countries facing a huge fiscal deficit and lack of development to the viability and potential of waqf as a catalyst for progress and economic activity. Originality/value: The paper shares the experience of Malaysia’s waqf-based universities, waqf fundraising, management and income utilisation. It accentuates the fact that waqf can help finance academic activities at universities and sheds light on some useful examples of waqf-based universities founded in earlier periods of Islamic civilisation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Data was collected from 68 manufacturing Shariah compliant companies’ annual reports for Malaysia, and 70 manufacturing Shariah compliant companies’ annual reports for Indonesia, for the year ended 2019. Descriptive and multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the data. The study found that HG Index and IT Usage Index were positive and significantly related to sustainability reporting for Shariah companies in both countries. However, ICG was not found to be significantly related to sustainability reporting for Shariah companies in Malaysia and Indonesia. This could be because the study focuses only on manufacturing companies, and in Malaysia and Indonesia, only about 24% of the companies and 13% of the companies respectively, have an ICG structure in place. The study suggests that to increase SR of Shariah compliant companies, there should be a good HG structure in place, and they should increase their level of IT usage in their business operations.

Specifically, this study intends to measure the differences in the Human Development Index (HDI) of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat and measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The response to these issues, the study estimates the value of the Human Development Index (HDI) at a minor level; the individual and household levels. 100 recipients of zakat (mustahik) from the three programs of zakat distribution by the zakat institution of Aceh Province, Indonesia (Baitul Mal Aceh - BMA) were selected as the sample of the study using a combination of purposive and proportionate stratified random samplings. These zakat programs include zakat for cancer and thalassemia patients, zakat for one family one undergraduate scholarship, and zakat for buying working capital for the poor families. The paired t-test is adopted to assess the differences in HDI of zakat recipients before and after receiving zakat, while the multiple linear regression is used to measure the effect of zakat on the HDI and its components. The study found that, after receiving zakat, the HDI of zakat recipients is higher than before. Zakat is also recorded to have a significant positive effect on the HDI, while the family size affected negatively the HDI and the types of zakat and profession of zakat recipients have an insignificant effect on the HDI. These findings suggest the positive role of zakat in improving human development and it could be used as one of the instruments to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs agenda in Indonesia. © 2020 Hellenic Association of Regional Scientists.

Data analysis is based on all 44 listed plantation companies on Bursa Malaysia between 2016 and 2018. The study utilizes a content analysis adapted from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)—G4 guideline, Sustainability Accounting Standard Board guidelines, and Bursa Malaysia Guidelines 2018, to measure sustainability disclosure quality (SDQ). Results from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis corrected for standard errors indicate that shariah-compliant status and internal mechanisms (board size, the presence of women directors, the existence of sustainability committees, and CEOs with business knowledge) significantly improve SDQ. Firm size, firm age, leverage, growth, and Big 4 auditors also significantly improve SDQ. The study provides useful insights into the importance of women directors and the presence of sustainability committees towards SDQ. This study contributes to the discussion that internal mechanisms (board size, independent boards, women directors, sustainability committees) and firm characteristics (shariah compliant, family ownership, CEO ownership, foreign ownership) can increase sustainability reporting and disclosure quality. The measurement of SDQ is novel in Malaysian context even though the methodology is often used in the literature. © 2023 by the authors.},

The work that explored this subject largely concentrated on the ideals of charitable practices, such as the faith-based tenets of social welfare as an Islamic communal practice and the religiously mandated form of almsgiving (zakat). But during the late 1990s, a new generation of scholars challenged the assumption of charity across the region as only a pious act and sought to address the dearth of literature on the subject. They shifted critical focus onto the history of philanthropy to consider and account for the social, economic, and political structures that shaped a wide range of charitable practices, activities, institutions, benefactors, and recipients. They also interrogated how communities determined the parameters of need, developed notions of the “deserving poor,” and mediated the relationship between the ideals and practices of beneficence. Overlapping fields such as social history and women's studies as well as analytics of gender, class, and national identity informed and advanced historical studies of charity and philanthropy across the Middle East. The subfield continues to innovate with new work across academic disciplines and new publishing venues for further studies of charity in the region across time periods. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This research paper aims to determine the factors needed to propose a platform where waqf (Islamic endowment) organizations can collaborate with government public hospitals to develop corporate waqf hospitals. Consequently, the elements of governance and sustainability are included in the management of corporate waqf hospitals thereby leading to the corporatization of public hospitals. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the qualitative research methodology and undertakes content analysis of data collected from journal articles, magazines and official websites. Data analysis involves open coding with NVivo 12. Findings: General findings from the literature review have shown that architectural and engineering fundamentals were essential factors in the success of past waqf hospitals of the era between 8th and 14th centuries. In that era, the decentralized waqf-based hospitals employed the mutawalli (the trustee/manager of the waqf assets) to govern the administration of the hospitals. Present corporate waqf hospitals can exploit the elements identified from past waqf-based hospitals and additionally adopt the private-public partnership model in the form of a muḍārabah (profit-sharing contract) agreement to design a sustainable waqf governance model for Malaysian public healthcare services. Research limitations/implications: The proposed platform is designed for a corporate waqf model developed in collaboration between Malaysian waqf institutions and public healthcare services. It abides by both the Malaysian fatwa (Islamic rulings) on waqf and the laws of the Malaysian Government. Practical implications: There is potential for developing the Malaysian corporate waqf-governance healthcare model which will enable the hospital to provide better quality healthcare to more patients through upgrading the quality of equipment used in hospitals and/or better facilities at equal or lower costs. Consequently, this will not only improve waqf management and distribution but also result in reduction of government expenditure. Social implications: This research promotes the concept of a corporate waqf hospital which will provide innumerable beneficial healthcare services in terms of improved healthcare quality at affordable costs to the general public and at no cost to the poor and the underprivileged. Originality/value: Although waqf has played an important role as a vehicle for Islamic financing in the society for centuries, a model of collaboration or partnership of waqf with public healthcare services has yet to be explored and developed. With proper corporate governance and well-managed sustainability in a corporate waqf model, this newly developed partnership between waqf institutions and public healthcare providers can be a first step in many more interesting collaborative arrangements that can be established between waqf institutions and public services in the future. © 2021, Raja Aishah binti Raja Adnan, Mahazan Abdul Mutalib and Muhammad Ridhwan Ab Aziz.},

The objective of this article is to analyse and examine the related literatures on Waqf towards community development from 2010 to 2020. Descriptive research is employed as the methodology of this article based on a number of literatures on Waqf and community development within a ten-year duration. Exactly 100 articles were gathered from on World of Science (WoS), Scopus, Google Scholar, and Mendeley software using specific keywords, namely “Waqf and Community Development,” “Waqf and Economic Development,” and “Waqf + Community Development.” The selected articles were subsequently analysed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) software. This study discovered several variables such as the number of publications by year, the number of authors, the subject area of articles, the methodology used, publications based on country, and classification of publications used by the respective researchers. The results showed that most of the previous studies which have discussed Waqf towards community development are more on managerial aspects, suggesting that wider areas need to be explored and discussed. © 2021.

	abstract = {In many countries, one strategy has emerged to resolve the challenges for improving access to credit facilities by creating a microfinance institution (MFI) that provides credit to low-income families. However, as a Muslim majority country, Indonesia has established a new form of MFI that comply with Shariah's Shariah Microfinance Institution (SMFI). Besides the shariah based product, SMFI has existed in rural areas, including Pesantren is known as Micro Waqf Bank (MWB). It has created to solve the poverty issues among low-income families that live in rural areas. Also, the main goal of MWB is to provide the convenience platform regarded as the business capital and financing to middle-lower income people and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). In line with the vital role of MWB, the present study is written to investigate the effect of MWB sector expansion in reducing the poverty issues among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. This study utilizes the secondary data collected from two sources, i.e. Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and Islamic Microfinance Institutions and Micro Waqf Banks (IMFI - BWM) for 2018 2019. This study found that MWB financing has a significant negative effect on poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. We also found that the number of MWB does not significantly affect poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, Indonesia. On the basis of the study findings, we concluded that MWB plays an important role in reducing poverty among rural communities. In contrast, increase MWB financing institution will be alleviating the poverty among them. Also, the number of MWB has not been fully affected by the number of low-income families in rural areas, Indonesia, due to the small number of operated MWB in Indonesia. © IEOM Society International.},

	abstract = {Zakat in Islam has historically been a vital institution in fulfilling religious needs and social welfare. Its effectiveness in medieval and modern Islam is evident. However, this institution is seemingly not without inefficiencies. Ineffectiveness distribution process and lack of transparency in the zakat management are commonly cited as key impediments (bin Khatiman et al., 2021). Blockchain is expected to solve these issues due to its ability to record and trace every transaction, allowing administrators to discharge their accountability to zakat stakeholders. Thus, this study intended to develop a zakat collection blockchain system with the aim to provide economical and integrated continuous real-time zakat transactions, transparency and traceability by developing smart contracts in zakat management. The study employed four stages of process based on waterfall model starting from the interview session and analyse of the standard operating procedure (SOP) on zakat collection in the Zakat Collection Centre or Pusat Pungutan Zakat-Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan (PPZ-MAIWP). Then, design requirement specification (DRS) is employed after being reviewed and approved by PPZ-MAIWP. The results show that the development of blockchain in the zakat collection system could be eradicating extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity among the community in the country. The study contributes through a transparent and reliable environment for exchanging data and carrying out transactions through a decentralized digital ledger technology to record anything of value and as a result able to ensure transparency, reliability, trust ability and traceability of the zakat transactions. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction to The Problem: Nigeria's Q4 2021 Real GDP reached N20.33 trillion, with a 3.98% YoY growth, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth post-2020 recession. Despite this, the economy is deemed in crisis. Concerningly, the government is accumulating more debt to service existing obligations, posing sustainability issues and conflicting with Shari’ah wealth management principles. Purpose: This study aims to analyze the impact of Islamic law on effective debt management in Nigeria, specifically addressing the consequences of economic crises that result in substantial national borrowing. Additionally, it aims to highlight Sharia jurisprudence as a viable solution to alleviate Nigeria's economic challenges. Design/Methodology/Approach: The Methodology employed in this study is purely doctrinal method of legal research. Hence, the study places reliance principally on the available literature by which the study explores relevant materials such as text books, journals and internet facilities. Importantly, the study finds most useful the primary sources of Shari’ah which are the Qur’an and Sunnah as well as the secondary sources which include Qiyas and Ijma’. Findings: The study finds that the economic crisis which Nigeria has found itself as a result of the multiplier effect of excessive public borrowing cannot be divorced from the adoption of the conventional economic system. The result reveals further that Islamic law plays significant roles in the efficient management of debt as was confirmed in the Malaysian Shari’ah compliant public debt management practices. The study proposes, by way of recommendation, the practice of Islamic Wealth Management to cushion the effect of the deficit budgets and the onerous debts on Nigeria and increase investment activities with a view to impacting positively on the country’s GDP. The study is therefore most relevant to the policymakers in the Ministry of Finance, Debt Management Office, as well as the Lawmakers in the country. © 2023, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

This study uses a fixed effect model to analyze the relationship between variables. The findings show that the Islamic human development index, as a proxy for the quality of human resources, supports the reduction of poverty in OIC countries. Furthermore, the zakat, voice and accountability, and trade openness have a negative and significant relationship with poverty. The quality of governance, population, inflation, and exchange rate, on the other hand, has no significant effect on the poverty rate. These findings can be used as the foundation for state government as the policymaker to solve poverty.

	abstract = {This study examines zakat (obligatory charity) as a tax deduction in Aceh. Currently, the existing legal rule stipulates that zakat paid by muzakkī (zakat payers) to the National Zakat Board (BAZNAS) and Zakat Official Institution (LAZ) is deducted from taxable income. However, this rule has not been applied since there is no Government Regulation. This empirical legal study used a statutory approach, analyzing the point of view of legal politics theory. This study concludes that the State and Islamic Law in Aceh are closely related to the political context of Indonesian law. The government regulations from the Old Order to the Reform Era related to Islamic Law or Muslims have been greatly influenced by political configurations. When the configuration is democratic, the legal character embraces democratic values and vice versa. As a result, the legal regulations regarding zakat have not yet been enforced due to the strong political configuration. However, referring to the arguments and logic of legal politics that the government is democratic towards the aspirations in Aceh, the Governmental Regulation Draft/Rancangan Peraturan Pemerintah (RPP) for Zakat as Tax Deduction will strengthen the previous legal rule, stipulating zakat as a tax deduction factor. The unification of zakat and taxes in one legal instrument by the government, which has political and structural authority, will be able to realize justice and economic and social welfare of the community as the primary goal of zakat. © 2022, Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University (UIN) Jakarta.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose Islamic solutions to the Covid-19 health and economic crises, specifically using Islamic social finance (ISF) instruments, including zakat, infaq and waqf. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the qualitative content analysis method, guided by a model of composite approaches of poverty alleviation in Islam, integrated Islamic commercial and social finance (IICSF) and crisis management of Umar bin Khattab, to construct various programs and/or policy actions toward economic recovery in Indonesia. Findings: The results show that ISF with its instruments, especially zakat, infaq and waqf could help the government and the economy to recover from the crisis. The proposed solutions include: save lives, including medical assistance using zakat-infaq and health-care waqf using waqf; save households, by creating a social safety net and graduation program using zakat-infaq; save businesses, especially micro-small enterprises (MSEs), through financial and business assistance (especially digital marketing) leveraging zakat-infaq-waqf and save financial institutions, especially micro-small financial institutions, by the development of cash waqf and the adoption of fintech and IICSF, especially in Islamic financial institutions targeting MSEs. Research limitations/implications: This study is exploratory in nature, which needs further investigations using more sophisticated qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Practical implications: If the above programs using ISF instruments are implemented, the economic surplus would be re-established and the acceleration of economic recovery can be realized. Social implications: The successful adoption of ISF could at the same time reduce poverty, accelerate MSEs development and improve equitable well-being. Originality/value: The Covid-19 pandemic has caused health, economic and social problems, which must be solved holistically, including ISF within IICSF. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The literature gap in microfinance paradox of double bottom line (financial performance vs. outreach) has always been an interesting area of research. This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIs’ to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 405 scientific papers on zakat recorded in the Scopus database until 2021. Various tools have been used – Microsoft Excel for frequency analysis, VOSviewer for data visualization, and Harzing’s Publish or Perish for metrics and citation analysis. This study finds that the number of zakat literature has increased significantly and consistently over the last ten years. The fields of Social Science, Business, Management, Accounting, Economics, and Finance are areas where zakat literature often appears in and is based in countries in the US, Europe and Asia. English is used in most zakat literature, along with several other languages like Malay, Arabic, German, Indonesian, Slovak, and Turkish. Research results also indicate that the zakat literature is mainly found in the subject areas of economics, finance, management, and accounting. The use of keywords such as zakat, Malaysia, zakat institution, poverty alleviation, zakat distribution, zakat management, social welfare, education, efficiency, and human are widespread. This study also found that Malaysia, Indonesia, America, Saudi Arabia, and Britain have become the five countries that have played a major role in creating collaborative zakat research. The findings of this study provide important implications for improving the practice and reach of zakat globally. © 2022. Global Journal Al-Thaqafah. All Rights Reserved.},

The object under study is a waqf managed by the Muhammadiyah Regional Board (PDM) of Lumajang East Java, Indonesia; a gas station business unit called SPBU Shirkah Amānah. PDM of Lumajang is taken as the subject of research because it has succeeded in managing profitable and productive waqf in business entities, and is playing a role in the community's economic empowerment. In this study, the data is collected through interviews, document reviews, and observations. The findings of this study show that creative innovation in developing productive waqf both in the form of business entities and business cooperation models conducted by PDM of Lumajang can generate a significant contribution in opening new jobs and investment. Further, it can also increase the community's financial income, increase social service facilities, and provide financial contribution to the sustainability of religious and social activities. Accordingly, it is argued that this productive waqf is likely able to play a significant role in the empowerment of the community's economy and might also be adapted to be a pilot model for productive waqf management. © 2021.

For recipients of the results (mauquf 'alaih), endowments will spread goodness to those who obtain waqf results and people who need help, such as the poor, orphans, disaster victims, people who have no business. Waqf also provide great benefits for the advancement of science, such as assistance for instructors and students, as well as various services for the benefit of other people.

This study aims to explore the implementation of Corporate Waqf Core Principles (CWCP), a set of sharia principles for corporate waqf implemented in the growth of waqf in Indonesia. This study uses qualitative research with a specific focus on comparative analysis of the advantages of waqf management at two different institutions that develop corporate waqf, Waqf Board Foundation of Universitas Islam Indonesia (YBW UII) Yogyakarta and Pesantren Tebuireng in Jombang. YBW UII Yogyakarta has developed productive waqf assets and immovable objects through professional and profitable multi-company institutions, ensuring that the waqf’s results expand and the benefits fly. Pesantren Tebuireng, on the other hand, understands the implementation of CWCP in the framework of productive waqf administration and management by conceptualizing the productivity of waqf assets through corporate and institutional management. The two models of waqf management methods ensure that waqf management within the corporate institutional framework is more productive and produces long-term outcomes and benefits. However, there are certain deviations in the implementation of the CWCP which has not used shares as waqf assets. The development of this waqf model in Indonesia can accelerate community economic development. © 2022 Miftahul Huda and Lukman Santoso.},

The paper aims at accessing the potential of Islamic microfinance for the purpose of achieving the economic empowerment in Tunisia. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire survey method is used. The method is intended for some of the beneficiaries of Zitouna Tamkeen (ZT), the only Islamic microfinance institution in Tunisia. Responses are analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences program. Findings: The authors infer that though the Islamic and conventional microfinance have similar objectives, the methods are different. What is more, the economic empowerment requires not only financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, but also skill development. The results of the survey reveal that ZT has contributed to certain economic empowerment of most of ZT's beneficiaries. In addition, the authors bring to the fore that providing supportive infrastructure and investment is a prominent component of the economic empowerment process. Research limitations/implications: In the paper, the sample is limited. Practical implications: The authors have highlighted that some structural barriers to entrepreneurship – such as legal, operational and marketing challenges – need to be addressed in a practical way.

Subsequently, it also examines the effect of gender as a moderator in the model. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data was collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 381 beneficiaries of PROCAPEC – a major Islamic microfinance provider in Mauritania. In methodology, the study uses confirmatory factor analysis to identify relevant involuntary factors affecting usage, followed by structural equation modelling to test the impact of these factors on the usage of Islamic microfinance (IsMF) products. Findings: Two of the four factors are statistically significant in affecting the usage of IsMF products, namely, affordability and eligibility. Gender is a moderator in the relationship between affordability and usage, as well as eligibility and usage. Practical implications: Policymakers, practitioners and managers of Islamic microfinance institutions can consider these factors and focus on strategies, including pricing and promotion, which aim to further develop the Islamic microfinance industry in Mauritania. Also, reducing documentation required from clients and adopting lenient rules to provide suitable products will enhance the use of IsMF products, which may lead to more customers’ attraction. Originality/value: Although several researchers have articulated financial inclusion, this study sheds light on a specific dimension of financial inclusion to determine the factors impacting IsMF products’ usage. In Mauritania, there are few studies about microfinance. This study will be amongst the pioneer contribution to the geographical gap. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Therefore, it is vital to support local potential to achieve long-term success. Waqf generosity is one form of social development that has been institutionalized in society.

This study employs a case study method to comprehend the real life of the waqf spatial entity in the urban village. The research location is Tugurejo Village, Tugu District, Semarang City. The study deviates from the grand theory to investigate the events at the study site. Interview, observation, and secondary data are used to acquire data; descriptive methods are used to analyze the data, and the research findings are fed back into the grand theory.

This study is a normative legal study using the maslāhah mursalah approach. The data analyzed is literature from books of fiqh scholars, textbooks, scientific journals, and other sources. Result of this study shows that Islam can regulate the management of zakat assets through the socio-economic empowerment of the people, preventing wealth accumulation in one group and reducing poverty. Mustahik, previously limited to short-term goals and institutional charity, now appears to have long-term benefits, including reducing poverty and empowering the community's economy. Mustahik is also useful for marginalized people, people with disabilities, and people experiencing moral and social deprivation, including mental health. The fact that the spread of this group is not limited to social media, but has also spread to campuses, schools, and being part of modern lifestyle needs urgent responses from various stakeholders, particularly in distributing zakat for LGBT community in Indonesia. The LGBT group is a legal reality that arises due to psychological and medical factors and entities caused by deviant associations. This research contributes to the Indonesian government's strategic steps to address the LGBT through zakat empowerment. So that in this way the group slowly through rehabilitation using zakat they experience awareness about life behavior that is in accordance with Islamic law in a dignified way. © 2021 Scripta Judaica Cracoviensia.

	abstract = {Purpose: The problem of poverty in the Muslim world has been posing multi-faceted challenges to the life of individuals and the relations of people. Although this problem has been gaining scholarly attention and raised in relation to various issues ranging from social injustice, rampant corruption, societal instability, wide social polarization and insurgent movements that affect the regional peace and stability at large, neither effective economic mechanism proposed nor implemented to address the problem effectively. In this regard, it is also important to appreciate the recent initiations in the field of Islamic economics to present an optional view to the existing and alien economic models in the Muslim world. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to fill up this research gap by proposing a model of mobilizing funds through the global cash-waqf institution. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts content analysis to construct this global cash waqf model for poverty alleviation in Muslim countries. Findings: The “global cash-waqf model” was proposed as an alternative that could be implemented and used to overcome the poverty matter in Muslim countries. It is assumed that the model will facilitate the fund mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return is going to assure full distribution and redistribution of wealth to eradicate the poverty in the Muslim world. The model was structured with a global vision in both the collection side and the distribution side. Originality/value: The model will facilitate the fund’s mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return achieves an Islamic goal of distribution and redistribution of wealth to assure the well-being of all humanities in the society. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It considers Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM) as the study setting and adopts a quantitative approach involving 120 women microentrepreneurs. The questionnaire was distributed to women micro-entrepreneurs in Selangor state employing a convenience sampling method. The model was analysed utilising the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that Islamic microfinancing, human capital, and ICT usage positively influence the performance of women micro-entrepreneurs. The empirical findings enhance the literature by extending the resource-based view (RBV), a soft theory in the organisational theory literature, by incorporating Islamic microfinancing in the context. It is hoped the study will assist IMFIs and governments in strengthening infrastructures, developing comprehensive business strategies, and educating women micro-entrepreneurs about the possibilities of the digital economy for long-term business sustainability and development. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to assess enterprise risk management (ERM) practices in waqf institutions (WIs) along with their strengths and weaknesses; highlight ERM trends in WIs; and determine the best ERM practices for these institutions. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected via structured interviews with nine WI managers in Malaysia. A standardised questionnaire was adopted for the interviews, which focussed on ERM implementation in WIs. The collected data were analysed in three steps, namely, data reduction, data display and verification/conclusion. The frequency distribution of these data were then illustrated and the mean values and differences of the studied groups/variables were examined. Findings: WIs have a sub-optimal ERM implementation, whose aspects need to be improved over time. These institutions have focussed on their ERM practices at the strategic level yet ignored those at the operational level. Specifically, WI officers have well-defined internal environments and objectives, but risk monitoring, which ensures effective implementation of ERM, is lacking. The presence of risk management committees and units may be linked with the successful implementation of ERM. However, ERM knowledge and top management support do not show clearly associations with ERM implementation. WIs should focus on improving their ERM implementation governance. Research limitations/implications: Findings underscore the need for WIs to launch a formal ERM programme and for relevant stakeholders to create the appropriate infrastructures that support ERM implementation, including amended rules, ERM policies and allocated funds for training and education, to promote ERM implementation knowledge and awareness. The successful implementation of ERM not only improves the service quality, sustainability and performance of WIs but also promotes the national waqf agenda as a key economic driver. Originality/value: ERM in non-profit organisations, such as WIs, has received limited research attention relative to that in profit-driven organisations despite having unique risks. To the best of the knowledge, this study is the first to identify those trends that explain ERM practices and to determine the ERM best practices of WIs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A Tawhidic concept premised on the Quran and Sunnah was used to underpin the development of the proposed corporate waqf model. Content analyses of existing academic literature on Waqf, followed by preliminary semi-structured interviews on groups of Chief Executive Officers, SIRC officers, Islamic Scholars and Academics, were conducted. The key challenges faced by waqf organisations are as follows: i) the development of waqf properties is not economical; and ii) the current waqf model does not support the wealth creation, wealth enhancement and wealth distribution to the ummah. These weaknesses have motivated this study to propose a new corporate waqf model; one that encompasses an enhanced governance structure and management setting. This new model treats waqf as an effective mechanism that can strengthen the economic growth of Malaysia. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Efficiency is essential for an institution because it can measure how well resources are used to achieve its specific goals (Wahab & Rahman, 2011). Zakat institutions must be managed efficiently, so they are maximized in promoting socio-economic goals, especially poverty alleviation (Wahab & Rahman, 2013). This study aims to analyze the efficiency level of Baitul Mal districts/cities of Aceh Province in Indonesia. Efficiency measurement uses a nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach during 2018–2020. DEA analyzes the interaction between input variables consisting of socialization costs, number of amil, and operational costs, with output variables comprising the total collection and distribution of zakat, infaq, and sadaqah (ZIS). The results show that 11 Baitul Mal out of 69 decision-making unit (DMU) (15.94%) are efficient overall, technical, and scale. As for technical efficiency, there are 16 Baitul Mal (23.19%) that are efficient, the remaining 26 Baitul Mal (40.58%) have a score below 60, and 27 Baitul Mal (36.23%) have a score above 60. Regency Baitul Mal Aceh Besar became the only Baitul Mal that achieved efficiency throughout the research period. The source of Baitul Mal’s inefficiency comes from all variables. Baitul Mal must optimize socialization costs by 60.68%, operational costs by 33.60%, and the role of amil by 3.20%. Furthermore, Baitul Mal must increase the amount of ZIS collection by 46.29% and the distribution of ZIS by 52.84% to achieve efficiency. © 2023, Virtus Interpress. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to develop cash waqf models for Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT), a special Islamic microfinance institution in Indonesia, combining Islamic social finance in Baitul Maal (house of wealth) division and Islamic commercial finance in Baitut Tamwil (house of asset development) division, as integrated Islamic social and commercial microfinance in Indonesia, to achieve triple bottom-line, including outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Delphi and analytic network process methods, with three groups of relevant respondents, including experts (academic), BMT practitioners and regulators. Findings: The results show that the best cash waqf model for BMT is “BMT as Nazir (waqf manager) and also as cash waqf receiver Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Penerima Wakaf Uang (LKSPWU)”, followed by “BMT Association as representative Nazir of several certified BMTs”. Moreover, “long-term investment deposit” is the best to account cash waqf in the BMT balance sheet. With regard to financing, the most preferred one is “financing to regular Micro and Small Enterprises” of BMT members. Research limitations/implications: Having allowed BMT to be Nazir (waqf manager), this research might only benefit Indonesian policymakers, such as the Financial Services Authority and the Ministry of Cooperatives, BMTs and the National Waqf Board. But it may also benefit other countries which have similar characteristics. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt several alternatives of best models in managing cash waqf most appropriate for their specific conditions. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help the social activities of the Baitul Maal through social cash waqf and, indirectly, by productive cash waqf. Originality/value: Studies have been limited, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study discussing the integrated cash waqf model, cash waqf account and cash waqf investment appropriate for BMT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

How does their turn toward transnational religious giving influence their perception of the state’s responsibilities regarding social welfare provision? Based on ethnographic fieldwork research with registered non-profit organizations collecting and distributing Islamic alms (zakat and sadaqa) in the state of Uttar Pradesh, this article examines how local and transnational religious giving affects the ways in which members of these Muslim philanthropic organizations imagine citizenship and welfare responsibilities in India. Distributive practices within these organizations show a dual focus on fostering Muslims’ economic independence and self-sufficiency by mobilizing local and transnational charitable networks on the one hand and improving access to state welfare on the other. The co-existence of these somewhat divergent strategies suggests that while the state is considered partial and uncaring, it also remains viewed as an indispensable welfare provider. More generally, these observations bring forth a discussion on the extent and effects of the transnationalisation and privatisation of welfare in globally connected South-Asia. © The Author(s) 2022.},

This volunteering initiative is conducted by an Islamic-oriented Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) with the aim of assisting the B40 in Sabah during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores the allocation of COVID-19 donations facilitated by Islamic NGOs and the motivating elements behind these efforts to organise volunteer initiative for the B40 group in Sabah, encompassing both urban and rural areas. Data gathering employs qualitative methods by conducting in-depth interviews with representatives of Islamic NGO leaders, notably Sabah An-Najiyah Charity Organisation (PKAN) and Aman Palestin Sabah (APS). The study’s findings indicate that the expression of ta’awun, demonstrated through NGO Islamic charity, extends beyond irregular or occasional material assistance. It also encompasses aid that has the potential to transform the mindset and lifestyle of the B40 group towards an Islamic way of life. The motivation to persist in serving others is fueled by the inherent resilience cultivated through adherence to Islamic principles, which emphasise the perpetual concern for the ummah, the pursuit of virtuous deeds, and the pursuit of rewards in the hereafter. The type of work being referred to is what sets Islamic NGOs apart from other NGOs that also carry out social programmes focused on well-being. This study will give impact on how the activities of Islamic-oriented NGOs contribute to broader community development in Sabah, particularly on the empowerment of marginalized groups. © (2024), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah).

	abstract = {The growth of digital assets in recent periods are accompanied by negative externalities, which raise concerns over sustainability. This has influenced the news content on both conventional and social media outlets, leading to the creation of the index of cryptocurrency environmental attention (ICEA). Given the pivotal role of social and conventional media in forming investors’ attitudes and behavior in financial markets, we address this issue from the perspective of Islamic stocks, which by their nature represent a class of Shariah-compliant sustainable assets. With dataset spanning from 2014 onwards up to July 2022, we analyze how the ICEA induces market dynamics in Islamic stocks covering diverse economic sectors. By applying the bi-wavelet-based time-frequency econometric framework, our empirical findings reveal time-varying levels of coherence between the ICEA and Islamic sectoral stocks, implying that the pricing and returns-generating dynamics across various economic sectors in Islamic markets are led by media coverage on environmental attention vis-à-vis the mining and trade of cryptocurrencies. Notwithstanding, our results indicate that the real “brick-and-mortar” categories of faith-based stocks, which contains the basic materials, consumer goods, industrials, and oil & gas sectors, provide attractive diversification attributes. Our findings are important for risk, portfolio, and policy management. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The problem of poverty still affects many countries and people worldwide, including Indonesia, especially in Jeneponto Regency. This study discusses the multi-partner governance model in managing the fundraising of Zakat funds to alleviate poverty. This model involves various institutions and actors to optimize the collection and use of Zakat funds to help those in need. This study analyzed indicators of actor participation, actor perspectives, actor accessibility, and determination of action to measure each institution’s and actor’s contribution to the multi-partner governance model. The analysis results show that the actor’s perspective dominates with the highest score, showing a strong interest in poverty alleviation. However, challenges in this model were also identified, including effective coordination and collaboration, power imbalances, limited resources, conflicts, personal interests, the complexity of the problem of poverty, and community participation. To overcome these challenges, this study recommends solutions such as building a suitable coordination mechanism, achieving a fair balance of power, increasing the allocation and management of resources, managing conflict and self-interest, adopting a holistic approach to overcoming the complexity of the problem of poverty, and building a mechanism for community participation that is effective. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The current study aimed to explore Imam Zarkasyi’s efforts to modernize pesantren institutions (Islamic boarding schools) through waqf organizations. The study drew on scholarly publications including books and academic papers as well as primary sources about Imam Zarkasyi by utilizing a qualitative, descriptive, and explanatory research methodology. The findings revealed that Zarkasyi’s educational perspectives and personal experiences significantly influenced the modernization of the waqf-based educational system. Zarkasyi’s proposals to enhance the pondok system’s modernity were based on his thorough understanding of the country’s educational culture. In response to the Dutch colonial administration, private educational institutions were established in 1926. These institutions offered students, educators, and community members the chance to acquire essential life skills and values in a unique educational setting. To ensure the continuity of these institutions, Zarkasyi transformed them into publicly owned enterprises through waqf establishment in 1958. As a waqif, he allocated a substantial portion of his fortune to be shared collectively among his three brothers. Zarkasyi aimed to ensure the sustainability of this approach by incorporating waqf principles which include attitudes, abilities, and praiseworthy characteristics. His initiatives continue to serve as a pedagogical model for private schools in Indonesia. This success motivates others to emulate the waqf concept, thereby contributing to the restoration and development of Islamic civilization. © The Authors.},

	abstract = {Temporary waqf, as an innovative form of waqf, offers a level of flexibility that permanent waqf lacks. By allowing fund allocation for a set period, temporary waqf holds significant potential for improving social welfare of the Muslim Community. It enables the use of funds to respond quickly to urgent and varied needs, such as infrastructure development and public facilities. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of temporary waqf in enhancing social welfare of the Muslim Community, focusing on fund allocation flexibility, investment efficiency, and positive economic impacts. The research adopts a library research approach, collecting and analyzi ng relevant literature on temporary waqf. Data are sourced from academic publications, regulatory documents, and waqf management-related reports. The analysis examines how temporary waqf affects the execution of social and economic projects and its overall influence on the community. Results indicate that temporary waqf allows for more adaptable and responsive fund allocation, accelerating the implementation of both social and economic programs. Temporary waqf funds can be invested in productive projects that generat e immediate benefits, such as building infrastructure and healthcare facilities. These projects contribute to improving the quality of life, stimulating local economic growth, and creating employment opportunities. The study suggests raising public awareness about t emporary waqf, formulating supportive policies, and promoting collaboration with the private sector and financial institutions. By implementing these recommendations, temporary waqf can further maximize its impact, enhance fund management efficiency, and contribute to sustainable development across Muslim Community. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

The research aimed to evaluate the current growth and publication trends in Islamic social finance studies, identify the most prolific contributors in the field, determine the most highly cited documents, and explore the research gaps and implications for future research perspectives in Islamic social finance. Data were collected from the Scopus database using keywords such “Islamic Social Finance” OR “Zakat” OR “Sadaqah” OR “Islamic Microfinance” OR “Waqf” and OR “Qard al-Hasan”. A total of 1316 documents were initially obtained, and after screening, 732 documents were included for analysis. The data were analyzed using tools like Biblioshiny and Microsoft Excel. The results showed that most publications were in 2022 (106 publications). The most significant author, affiliation and source were Saad, R.A.J. by the author (16 articles), International Islamic University Malaysia by affiliation (153 articles), and Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research by the source (38 publications). This study found the article entitled; ‘‘Waqf, perpetual charity and poverty alleviation” written by Sadeq, A.M. (2022) as the most global cited document with 100 citations. Moreover, based on the results of thematic map and evolution, Islamic social finance research was divided into three main themes: Holistic Islamic Socio-Economic Empowerment, Impactful Islamic Finance Optimization, and Islamic Socio-Economic Advancement. This study highlighted the need for further studies across diverse contexts, inclusion of impact measurement and evaluation, comparative studies and optimization in Islamic microfinance, governance, compliance, and trust in zakat institutions, economic growth and Islamic finance, influences of religiosity and the pandemic on Islamic finance, policy, regulatory frameworks, and best practices. By addressing these gaps, researchers can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and effectiveness of Islamic social finance in addressing community well-being and poverty. © (2024), (Elite Scientific Publications).

We introduce an innovative measure of sustainable investment conditions based on the degree of market preparedness to attract sustainable investments, and the percentage of managed assets eligible for sustainable investment. We further distinguish between conventional assets and Shariah-compliant managed assets. To account for potential confounding factors, we incorporate firm-specific and country-wide controls and perform endogeneity analysis. We find a robust inverse relationship between market preparedness and corporate cash holding. The impact of market preparedness depends on the firm's size and can manifest through both direct and indirect channels. However, the relationship between funds under management qualifying for sustainable investment and cash holdings is less straightforward. Our results underscore the influence of sustainability policies on firms' liquidity decision-making. These policies' effects are contingent on a broader institutional landscape. Our analysis implies that policies to promote market preparedness should be enhanced and that sustainable investment inflows into the region could be moderately increased by incorporating ESG criteria into the rules of Shari'ah-compliant funds. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

Data were gathered via questionnaires distributed to representatives of environmental care communities. The findings indicate that internal factors, particularly potential strengths, support the implementation of waqf forests. Internal and external factors contribute to these strengths, enhancing the potential for successful implementation. Weaknesses can be mitigated by leveraging existing strengths. External factors are categorized into opportunities, which can promote the development of waqf forest strategies, and threats, which necessitate strategic interventions. The analysis reveals that the strength factor scores higher overall than the weakness factor, suggesting a promising outlook for successful implementation. These research findings contribute to a deeper understanding of waqf forest implementation by thoroughly analyzing the relevant internal and external factors.

	abstract = {Cash waqf is a form of contemporary waqf that has great potential in the modern world. In Indonesia, despite its potential of 180 trillion per year, cash waqf collection, management, and distribution are not optimal. Nonetheless, the infrastructure sector in Indonesia faces obstacles, particularly in terms of funding. The innovation of the CWLFRA (Cash Waqf Linked DINFRA) model is, therefore, a solution to these two issues, as the proposed model is the result of an integration between efforts to optimize cash waqf and infrastructure financing via the Infrastructure Investment Fund (DINFRA). In this CWLFRA innovation, waqf funds will be allocated to the mauquf 'alaih from the profits of infrastructure investment funds, which will become a source of long-term usable assets. As a result, the purpose of this academic paper is to develop a model capable of bolstering the ecosystem of Islamic social financial institutions and maximizing the potential achievement of cash waqf in Indonesia as a means of implementing sustainable finance and an effective instrument in reviving national economy through infrastructure development. In addition, this study seeks to determine the viability of the potential for developing the productivity of cash waqf in an effort to increase the effectiveness of achieving cash waqf to support economic sustainability with infrastructure potential. Nine respondents representing academicians and expert practitioners from both the waqf and infrastructure sectors filled out questionnaires to collect data. According to the results of the Delphi test, all respondents believed that there was a relationship between the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) indicators, indicating that this model is implementable. Moreover, based on the level of agreement of respondents, this model has the potential to contribute positively to national economic recovery, become a sustainable source of social funds, optimize the potential of waqf in Indonesia, strengthen the ecosystem of waqf social finance institutions, and improve the quality of management and maintenance of Indonesia's infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that integrating financial waqf with existing public infrastructure could positively affect the sustainability of national economic development. The novel aspect of this paper is the proposed cash waqf management system, which can serve as a useful reference for policymakers and waqf institutions seeking to develop a more effective waqf concept in terms of collection, administration, and distribution. Consequently, this study aims to demonstrate the potential for cash waqf, which can be integrated with DINFRA's product through the innovation of the CWL-FRA model, to become an investment instrument and offer a diversity of options to the waqf community. © The Author(s) (2023).},

Qualitative method was used in this research with a phenomenological approach using the activity data from the Amil Zakat Infaq and Shadaqah of Muhammadiyah Institutions in empowering loan shark victims through the Bankziska program. The data sources were obtained from managers, volunteers, and loan shark victims who were the partners of Bankziska. The research results showed that the reasons for the Amil Zakat Infaq and Shadaqah of Muhammadiyah Institutions to lend zakat funds were the references from fiqh and fatwa, training studies, organizational encouragement, academic input, and it is easy to implement. The implementation of the Bankziska program had detailed standard operating procedures, starting from the beneficiary categories, distribution, and payment processes, to mitigating the risk of default. The al-Qarḍ al-Ḥasan program of Bankziska had an impact on improving the quality of skills, mental, intellectual, technological, communication, and religious studies of managers and volunteers. The impact of the program for partners was the awareness to abandon usury, reduced debt both in nominal terms and the number of loan sharks and an increase in the ethos of economic independence. This research contributes to providing discourse and alternatives for other social and religious fund management institutions in using zakat funds productively for economic empowerment through the al-Qarḍ al-Ḥasan contract for victims of loan sharks who have difficulty accessing Sharia financial institutions to obtain business capital or financing services. © 2024, Universitas Islam Negeri Mahmud Yunus Batusangkar.

	abstract = {This study employs a basic qualitative approach, analyzing two case studies in which the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) is the sole trustee of legitimate state waqf assets. Is there a significant difference in the management of these two waqf hotels, as far as the organization that manages them? This study also explores the connection between waqf principles and hotel management, with a particular emphasis on the distribution of waqf benefits generated by the waqf hotel business. The goal is to investigate different perspectives on decision-making, challenges, and achievements in the sector. A semi-structured interview was conducted with two representatives from SIRC and one from Yayasan Wakaf Malaysia (YWM), both of whom manage waqf hotels. This research is guided by the principles of Fiqh Al-Awlawiyyat, which provides a thorough understanding of Islamic legal principles governing waqf and contemporary hotel management. Two waqf hotels have been chosen for a review of the management style and ownership structure using the criteria that have been established. Interview data was thematically analyzed to identify recurring patterns and gain valuable insights. Preliminary findings demonstrate the importance of community support for this waqf hotel to optimize profits. Muslims bear a great deal of responsibility if they understand that the money, they spend to stay at this waqf hotel is for the benefit of third parties in need of assistance. This study makes practical recommendations for improving the sustainability and effectiveness of waqf hotels; ongoing promotion and awareness should be prioritized. Muslims must understand that choosing a waqf hotel is a responsibility, not an option.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Methodologically, the study employs a comparative qualitative analysis based on secondary data from academic literature, government reports, and institutional publications. The results show, first, Malaysia employs a centralized and technologically integrated approach, ensuring transparency and efficiency in zakat collection and distribution. In contrast, Turkey adopts a decentralized model driven by non-governmental organizations and community participation, fostering flexibility but posing challenges in standardization and oversight. Indonesia's hybrid model combines governmental oversight with private sector involvement, aiming to balance regulatory control with local adaptability, yet needs help in coordination and public trust. Second, the policy enhancements such as improved coordination mechanisms, strengthened regulatory frameworks, and enhanced public awareness to optimize Zakat's role in poverty alleviation and social welfare across Malaysia, Turkey, and Indonesia.

Additionally, it explores the establishment of relevant institutions to facilitate zakat collection and distribution. The study employs the method of comparative legal research, combined with exploratory research techniques, to examine taxation and zakat systems in different countries. The study’s findings indicate that incorporating zakat incentives, either in the form of tax credits or deductions, into Uzbekistan’s taxation system can enhance the role of zakat institutions in the country’s economy and reduce tax evasion to some extent. Moreover, it proposes a preliminary model of zakat management for Uzbekistan based on conclusions of the comparative study of various countries and analysis of the national legislation. Finally, the research highlights the necessity of a systematic approach to educate the public about zakat obligations, which is crucial for operation of proposed zakat management model and improving compliance. The study provides essential policy recommendations, including the implementation of zakat tax incentives, enhancing public zakat literacy, and ensuring the efficient operation of zakat institutions. By adopting these measures, the government of Uzbekistan can foster a more equitable and effective taxation system, contributing to socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. © 2024 by author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose: Conventional insurance creates a gap in the financial system across the world that manifests from the global financial and economic crisis. There is an increasing demand for insurance schemes that will bridge the gap of financial and economic crisis globally. More recently, there is an advocacy in Saudi Arabia for achieving Vision 2030 by various facets of human endeavours such as strengthening financial markets and boasting economic development. The purpose of this paper is to deeply explore policy and reinforcement of the legal framework of Islamic insurance as essential bedrocks in Islamic finance that are Shari’ah compliant to achieve Saudi Vision 2030 for overall sustainability of all spheres of human endeavours in the country. Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis and systematic literature review are used as methodological approaches in this paper. There are various sources of accessing secondary data used in this study such as online peer review, journals and library-based sources. Through the exploration of various secondary data, five major themes were identified in this study, namely, policy, legal framework, Islamic insurance, Islamic finance and Saudi Vision 2030. Analysis of various themes were done systematically in this paper. The methodology provides theoretical and practical foundations for reinforcing policy and legal framework for Islamic insurance, specifically in Islamic finance to achieve Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia. It is the policy and legal framework that can provide necessary dynamics for strengthening Islamic insurance in particular and Islamic finance in general towards attaining sustainable Vision 2030 in the country. Findings: The paper demonstrated that policy period is explicitly associated with Islamic insurance, whereby Takaful insurance is regarded as policyholder rather than shareholder-oriented. Similarly, it is established that there is need to specifically mention the policy period and the nature of contract in Islamic insurance should not be limited to only mutual cooperation among the participants in connection with the losses but it should capture element of sharing income generated from investment between insurer and policyholders using predetermined ratio for such as provided with theoretical legal framework (Shari’ah) in connection with Islamic insurance model as an integral part of Islamic finance. Research limitations/implications: It will depart completely from conventional insurance where borrowing of funds and investment are put at fixed interest (Riba), uncertainty (Gharar) and speculative ideas (Maisir). Avoidance of different elements ascribed with conventional insurance would enable Saudi Arabia to strengthen financial system and boast economic development with an emphasis on an effective policy and efficient legal framework towards attaining Vision 2030 in the country. Practical implications: The methodology provides theoretical and practical foundations for reinforcing policy and legal framework for Islamic insurance, specifically in Islamic finance to achieve Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia.

There is an increasing demand for insurance scheme that will bridge the gap of financial and economic crisis globally.

Recipients may receive zakat assistance in the form of both capital and job equipment, coupled with suitable training. Traditionally, zakat distribution has adhered to classical principles, involving monthly financial aid or limited working capital. However, this method is perceived as less effective in eradicating poverty. This study emphasises the significance of directing zakat towards income generation as a more impactful approach to poverty alleviation. To this end, this study explores classical and modern models of zakat disbursements for income generation, drawing from scholars’ perspectives in their respective eras. A qualitative approach for data collection and analysis was adopted based on the evidence from classical and modern literature. There are several methods of zakat disbursement for income generation, namely capital grants, loans, and training. Based on a survey of classical and modern literature, it was found that some classical scholars have granted such disbursements. Recognising the efficacy of this approach in helping zakat recipients, modern scholars are inclined to support income generation programs, including zakat loan provision. The evolution of this concept, coupled with its successful implementation, positions zakat as a key player in eradicating poverty among Muslims globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Purpose — This research examines cash waqf-linked ṣukūk (CWLS) and ascertains its viability in Malaysia under the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks of waqf (Islamic endowment) and ṣukūk (Islamic investment securities). This is explored with a view to a possible implementation of CWLS in Malaysia by Islamic social and commercial finance institutions. Design/Methodology/Approach — The research adopts a qualitative methodology and uses content analysis in synthesising relevant data to determine the viability and prospects of CWLS in Malaysia. Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted, and data obtained therefrom was analysed alongside published literature on CWLS to identify issues in the applicable waqf and ṣukūk legal and regulatory frameworks that pertain to CWLS viability. Findings — The combination of cash waqf with ṣukūk is potentially an impactful financing mechanism for mobilising funds whereby charity is linked with productive and income-generating economic activities. CWLS facilitates the development of alternative social financing instruments that expedite social welfare and economic revival in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Indonesia demonstrates. However, Malaysia’s waqf legal and regulatory framework have established a decentralised system of waqf administration, which may impede the efficacy of the structure and operations of CWLS in the country. Hence the research proposes a reform of the framework to enable the establishment of a more capable and viable CWLS structure for digital, retail and institutional investors. Originality/Value — This research discovers hindrances to the prospect of CWLS in the legal, Sharīʿah and regulatory dynamics of waqf and ṣukūk in Malaysia that previous studies overlooked. This research provides an in-depth understanding of challenges to CWLS’ implementation in Malaysia with invaluable insight for regulators, policymakers, practitioners and researchers, thereby contributing to practical knowledge in the area. © Sherin Kunhibava, Aishath Muneeza, Zakariya Mustapha, Maryam Khalid and Thong Ming Sen.},

In wake of the current scenario, this study is aimed at exploring how the COVID-19 pandemic is influencing the sustainability of entrepreneurship particularly from a female perspective and further providing insights into the role of Islamic financial institutions in the sustainability of businesses during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study that takes social constructivism approach to study the underlying phenomenon. Semi-structured interviews are conducted to collect primary data. Secondary data are also utilized in this study to theoretically define various concepts relating to entrepreneurial sustainability. The application of thematic analysis revealed various risks associated with sustainability. The interviews reveal the ground realities and tell us about the hardships being faced by the entrepreneurs due to ongoing crises. The participants of the study also shed light on the role of Islamic financial institutions during the pandemic. Findings: The study results revealed that it may look impossible for women entrepreneurs to halt or avoid the adverse consequences of the pandemic; however, a few female entrepreneurs strived to guard their existing portfolios with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. Whereas, several women, especially those running home-based businesses, lost their income streams. Despite these rapid challenges, most female entrepreneurs are working on inventive online systems to sustain their business activities during the crisis. Finally, guidelines are suggested which can help achieve sustainability of the entrepreneurial startups. Research limitations/implications: The outcomes of this study are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and Islamic financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during severe disasters like COVID-19. Moreover, the study is a helpful tool for women entrepreneurs to avert the worst impact of the pandemic with the help of Islamic microfinance institutions. The themes of this study help generate realistic information to appraise the strategies to create facilitating business environments that drive the women to carry out the entrepreneurial activity during any crisis like the COVID-19. Practical implications: The results of this study provide evidence that crisis can be anticipated up to some extent if entrepreneurs become able to take proactive decisions in case of expected or identifiable threats. The study may also help the women entrepreneurs to comprehend the serious consequences of the pandemic by shifting their mode of financing to Islamic finance. Although this pandemic is a cause of physical discomfort instead this research may encourage the female entrepreneurs not to lose heart, just find the potential opportunities for their home-based and small businesses and manage funding from the Islamic microfinance institutions. Originality/value: The study adds to the existing literature on entrepreneurial sustainability with a particular focus on the role of Islamic microfinance institutions for women entrepreneurs' sustainability in Pakistan. Secondly, the study employs the entrepreneurial sustainability model (ESM) that, according to the best of our knowledge, has not been used by the researchers earlier to study the given research phenomenon. Thirdly, the study findings are expedient for funding agencies, government authorities and financial institutions as well as for non-government institutions to establish sustainable and broader policies for women to become successful entrepreneurs during disasters like COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This article investigates alignment of the Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) with Maqasid Shari’ah principles within Indonesia's agricultural sector. Amidst growing interest in embedding Islamic principles across various sectors, the WRS emerges as a crucial mechanism designed to facilitate proper storage and management of agricultural commodities, adhering to Islamic law’s objectives. Through a comprehensive methodological approach, combining literature reviews, case studies, qualitative interviews, and regulatory analysis, this article explore the ethical and legal intersections between Islamic finance principles and agricultural commodity management. The findings reveal that aligning the WRS with Maqasid al-Shari’ah not only upholds ethical standards and justice in agricultural storage and distribution but also significantly contributes to the sector's development and stability by fostering trust among stakeholders. The research underscores the importance of social welfare and environmental sustainability in Islamic jurisprudence, advocating for holistic practices that serve broader community interests while respecting natural resources. The article highlights the potential of Shari’ah-compliant WRS to support ethical and sustainable business practices, enhancing the reputation and credibility of the agricultural sector within the Islamic financial and business community. The article recommends the integration of Maqasid al-Shari’ah values into the regulatory framework governing the WRS through continuous stakeholder engagement to ensure effective and sustainable implementation. © 2024 Electronicpublications.org Ltd.

The limited funds available for waqf-based forest development require nazhir to carefully choose the best location so that the asset can function optimally. However, no specific research has been conducted to guide the selection of the best location for this purpose. This study aimed to identify potential criteria to help determine the best site for developing a waqf-based forest. Several methods were used to collect the necessary data, including literature reviews, in-depth interviews, field observations, and focus group discussions. This study identifies four crucial criteria when selecting the best locations: a) legal, b) physical and biophysical, c) high conservation value and benefits, and d) management. In addition, each criterion has sub-criteria. Among all, legal issues receive the highest highlight as unresolved regulations can affect a forest's ownership and function. This study was the first to discuss these criteria. Future research should quantify the criteria suggested using GIS and conduct more field observations in existing waqf-based forests in Indonesia. © 2024 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

A thematic analysis was conducted of in-depth interview data from Kiai Pesantren regarding their perspectives on state fund management. Findings — The results show the importance of FTPA in state fund management, especially when aligned with Islamic principles. Fiscal transparency involves directing tax funds towards poverty alleviation alongside infrastructure development. The involvement of religious organisations can be aimed at fostering moral responsibility among officials, while citizen participation can be facilitated through open data for budget planning. The accountability of public officials must be accompanied by efforts to minimise corruption and enforce strict punishments for corrupt activities. Moreover, fully crediting zakat payments for Muslim taxpayers could improve tax compliance, but this requires assurance through future policy reforms. Originality/Value — This study contributes to the literature by integrating Islamic principles into the framework of FTPA.

It primarily examines the role of these digital modalities in enhancing philanthropic contributions, improving financial transparency, and achieving sustainability goals. The study explores the synergistic effects of combining digital accounting and digital zakat, and aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding their collective impact on sustainable business practices. The results confirm the primary hypothesis and show a positive correlation with corporate sustainability. Consistent with previous research, digital zakat is identified as a catalyst for stakeholder engagement and a facilitator of sustainable development initiatives. Similarly, digital accounting is associated with increased financial transparency, thereby strengthening corporate sustainability efforts. These findings underscore the need for further exploration and integration into corporate strategies and highlight the prospects of digital technology in strengthening corporate sustainability. The study provides strategic recommendations for businesses, policymakers, and academics to promote sustainable practices and align financial systems with broader sustainability goals. This research is central to deepening the understanding of digital technologies' ability to enhance sustainability in business contexts, and future studies should extend these findings to examine the complex dynamics of how digital solutions can optimize sustainability in different sectors and settings. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to find empirical evidence related to the influence of organisational capability and social capability on organisational sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation (OPZ). This study also wants to prove that OPZ's social capability can moderate the influence of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. Theoretical Framework: Providing professional organisational capacity is a form of OPZ's responsibility to improve the community's welfare through trustworthy zakat management. Thus, achieving organisational goals requires the importance of organisational capacity. Based on the stewardship theory, management is not motivated by individual goals but instead focuses on their primary goal for the organisation's benefit. Method: The methodology used in this study is a quantitative approach and the data analysis was carried out with the Moderated Regression Analysis model. Results and Discussion: The results of the research reveal that both organisational capacity and social capability have a positive influence on organisational sustainability. Furthermore, social capabilities have a positive moderating effect on the effect of organisational capacity on organisational sustainability. The test results show that the moderation in this study is included in the type of quasi-moderation. Research Implications: The results imply that the organisational capacity and social capability of OPZs have an essential role in determining organisational sustainability, where the social capability of amil zakat agencies becomes a determinant to strengthening organisational capacity in supporting the sustainability of amil zakat agencies. Originality/Value: This research provides new insights into the role of organisational capacity and social capability in achieving sustainability in the Amil Zakat Organisation.

Apparently, although Indonesian population is dominated by Muslim, the literacy of waqf is still considerably moderate, that waqf is widely known limited for masjid, school, and cemetery, while it can be utilized empower the community's economic condition. The purpose of this activity is to increase the literacy of rural communities on waqf and its use for community economic empowerment. Community service activities were carried out in Cipelang Village, Cijeruk District, Bogor Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia. Activities were conducted in the form of socialization and discussion in a hybrid manner, a combination of offline and online activities. Offline activities were supported by the village community. University students organized the Community Services Program at the Cipelang Village. The online activities were arranged by lecturer team from IPB University, Bogor. The results of the socialization program showed that only view people were aware with waqf and its use in real economy, even though most of them familiar with waqf terminology. The waqf socialization to the community made the community more aware of waqf and its use, including for community economic empowerment. The community also hoped to have the opportunity to use waqf funds for their economic empowerment, including for the development of Muslim friendly (halal) tourism, considering that in Cipelang Village prevails many traditional Islamic boarding schools. Therefore, further action to gather the waqf funds for empowering the potential is needed. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Most People’s Religious Schools (Sekolah Agama Rakyat-SAR) face financial constraints in managing and administering schools. Therefore, SAR administrators strive to obtain funds through instruments such as waqf, for example, cash waqf. However, until now, the implementation of cash waqf instruments in SAR has not received much attention among SAR administrators. Nevertheless, Sekolah Rendah Islam Tahfiz Integrasi Al-Fateh, Raub, Pahang (SRITI, Al-Fateh) is one of the SARs that has implemented cash waqf and has had a positive impact on the school’s development. The objective of this study is to identify the method of implementing cash waqf and to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation in sustaining the finances of Al-Fateh Integrated Tahfiz Islamic Primary School (SRITI), Raub, Pahang, Malaysia. This is a qualitative study. A face-to-face interview was carried out as a data collection method using semi-structured questions involving three respondents comprising the chairperson, a local officer, and a project manager of SRITI Al-Fateh. The study data was supported by secondary sources such as books, magazines, journals, articles, and others. The data obtained was analyzed using the content analysis method. The study outcome finds that SRITI Al-Fateh has collected waqf in the form of cash. The funds collected came from various groups of the society such as individuals and NGOs. From the funds, a two-story school building was successfully constructed, and a mosque (still being constructed), and they serve as an activity center for teachers and students. This study hopes that the method of implementation of cash waqf by SRITI Al-Fateh can serve as guidance for SAR in Malaysia and other educational institutions in the effort to sustain the school finances. Future work can be done by making comparisons with one or more other SARs to show the effectiveness of cash waqf implementation. © (2024), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah). All rights reserved.},

It combines Islamic principles with environmental conservation, as being waqf assets, a forest is prohibited from being sold, given, or inherited. An effective management strategy is crucial to ensure waqf-based forest productivity and sustainability. Some research has already been conducted, but the specific dimension remains unexplored. This study aims to identify essential aspects and effective management strategies to escalate waqf-based forest benefits. Using a comprehensive approach, this study combines a literature study, in-depth interviews, and a study case in Bogor Waqf Forest, Bogor Regency, Indonesia. The findings were analyzed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and further in-depth interviews as the validation process. There are six important considerations to optimize waqf-based forest management: legal, ecological, Islamic, economical, social, and aesthetic. The land’s legal status as waqf assets is recognized as the most crucial aspect to avoid possible conflict and sustainability in the future. Then, the following considerations are improved ecological and Islamic activities aspects, economic strategies, and social and aesthetic consecutively. This research is expected to provide a deeper investigation of the future management strategies for waqf-based forests. © 2024 The Author(s).},

This research paper aims to explore the role of waqf as an instrument for a sustainable growth system and to suggest a model for socioeconomic development in an economy like that of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research is based on analytical methods to arrive at the frameworks and a model that could facilitate the revival of waqf for community development/social inclusion in economies like that of Pakistan. Findings: As most of the OIC member states like Pakistan are facing serious financial problems due to debt servicing obligations, promoting Waqf for various socioeconomic and cultural functions is a vital requirement for such economies. The inability of the state institutions in providing necessary civic, health and education facilities to the public is causing serious harm to the balance of the society. It requires promoting a formal system of charity and using FinTech for waqf-based donations and financing the micro businesses. The perpetuity complimented by the profitability of the waqf properties makes the waqf institutions sustainable and effective when compared to individual charities. Research limitations/implications: This is conceptual research discussing the potential of waqf in light of its historical role. Researchers may undertake empirical studies on awqaf operations in various jurisdictions and their role in the empowerment of the poor. Practical implications: The research will provide the researchers with insight into the potential of waqf as a tool for community development. Besides, it will enable policymakers and implementation authorities to socialize charity for sustained benefits and welfare. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first major research that discusses the role of waqf in economies facing budgetary and trade deficits in the eradication of poverty and the promotion of social and economic entrepreneurship in realizing the community development targets for the economies like that of Pakistan. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the Urban Poor Development Scheme (UPDS) and the Rural Development Scheme (RDS), both of which are types of Islamic Microfinance Institutions. It examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these two categories of Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IsMFIs). The significant decline in economic activity during the pandemic has significantly impacted the lives of several people, especially those who are debtors of multinational Islamic Microfinance Institutions (IsMFIs). A more robust understanding of the need for financial inclusion and increased demand for digital financial services are two instances of the potential that Bangladeshi IsMFIs have identified their challenges. The significance of this research lies in the pivotal role that IsMFIs assume in alleviating poverty at the national level, namely among marginalized populations. This study fills the knowledge gap about the opportunities and challenges that COVID-19 poses for IsMFIs operating in Bangladesh. The principle behind this methodology is library research, which entails gathering and assessing data from various sources. Yearly reports from UPDS, RDS, and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics supplement data gathering. The study process was underpinned by the use of robust quantitative research methodologies. Strategies for expanding foreign financial institutions in Bangladesh following the COVID-19 pandemic are formulated based on the study results, highlighting the potential for significant growth and expansion in this sector. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the microfinance sector, this study examines the current scholarly discourse on the obstacles and prospects that IsMFIs in Bangladesh encounter. Furthermore, it will furnish astute insights concerning these obstacles and prospects. This study's findings provide practical guidance for policymakers and other stakeholders in advocating for IsMFIs, thereby mitigating the disease's impact on Bangladesh's impoverished population. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {The aims of the paper is to narrow the knowledge gap on Islamic banking and economics through analyzing concepts, instruments, features, significance, and contributions to economic growth and its difference from conventional banks. Islamic Banking is guided by shari’a law which derived from the holly Qur’an (Allah’s revelation) and Sunnah of the prophet Muhammed (Peace be up on him). Definitions, concepts, and instruments guiding Islamic Banking are clearly presented in this paper. The characteristics features of Islamic banking are divinely sourced, shari’ah compliant banking system, rich with numerous financial concepts, riba (usury) free banking system, garar (uncertainty) free banking system, prohibits injustice, and enjoys benevolence in transactions. Islamic banking is also advantageous over conventional one due to its more efficiency in operations, stabilize the economy, less moral hazard, and conveniences in poverty alleviation. Islamic banking is different from conventional one, with its emphasis on risk sharing and, for certain products, collateral-free loans, is compatible with the needs of poor and microentrepreneurs which promotes entrepreneurship, and hence, expanding Islamic banking to the poor could foster development under the right application. Islamic banking also offers loan products based on intangibles such as a businessperson’s experience and character. Bonds both Islamic bonds (sukuk) and conventional bonds are another deal of this paper. The sukuk market is the fastest growing area of Islamic finance. A major difference between the two kinds of bond is that conventional bond issuers pay interest to investors at regular intervals, whereas sukuk issuers share profits and losses with the parties to the business transaction. In addition, Islamic banking contributes more for economic and business growth like other conventional banks especially in rapidly growing interest of using Islamic banking due to its services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an essential component of the shariah corporation framework. In the current corporate model, CSR is still an option rather than a company objective. The need for CSR is still being debated among companies, with some believing that it is in the long-term self-interest of a business to be socially responsible, while others view CSR as weakening a business's primary purpose. Islamic law requires Muslims to not only be governed by the al-Quran and as-Sunnah but also to be subject to the objective of Syariah, namely Maqasid Syariah. The research aims to provide analysis and recommendations to improve the practice of CSR according to the concept of Maqasid Syariah. This qualitative research used doctrinal legal method with employing secondary data. The outcome of this research is significant as a basis for law reform to develop a Shariah Compliant Corporation. It is crucial to incorporate CSR into the Shariah-compliant business model to ensure that businesses are responsible not only for maximizing profits but also for contributing positively to society. The incorporation of CSR into the Syariah-compliant business model is crucial in achieving the objectives of Syariah, namely, the promotion of human welfare, justice, and sustainability. © 2023, Faculty of Law, Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta.

	abstract = {Engagement in research and development (R&D) is crucial not only for large companies but also for micro businesses. For micro enterprises, R&D can lead to innovation, which enable the development of new products and improve existing ones. This innovation is vital for micro-enterprises to stay competitive and build on their ability to meet the customers’ evolving needs. Potentially, R&D also helps micro businesses enhance their operational efficiency, reduce costs, and adopt sustainable practices, which are all essential for long-term viability. Unfortunately, micro-enterprises often encounter significant difficulties in engaging with R&D activities. Past studies have highlighted on the primary barriers for micro-enterprise to get involve with R&D such as limited financial resources, lack of access to advanced technology, and insufficient expertise. This paper examines the hurdles faced by Malaysia’s micro-enterprises in engaging with R&D activities. A questionnaire survey was conducted and 2,000 questionnaires were distributed, with 202 usable responses available for analysis. The study found that the availability of financial incentives for asset and working capital needs are positively viewed, but difficulties persist in securing loans for modern agriculture, digital transformation, and Shariah compliant businesses. While R&D boosts business growth and competitiveness, its impact on reducing operational costs and ensuring sustainability are unclear. Incubator centers provide valuable support but the lack of comprehensive mentorship programs has imposed difficulties for micro-enterprises to utilize the facilities. The findings give a clear indication to policymakers that enhancing support mechanisms is crucial in order to fully leverage the financial and R&D incentives for micro-enterprises. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This article aims to investigate the development of charitable crowdfunding and its impacts on Islamic philanthropy and its social justice trajectory in Indonesia. As the largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has thrived and undergone some legal and programmatic revolutions to promote social justice through Islamic philanthropy. However, this study demonstrates that the rapid growth of charitable crowdfunding in the last decade has some impacts on the social justice trajectory of Islamic philanthropy, particularly in the areas of inclusivity, sustainability, and governance. This study draws from the case of Kitabisa, the largest crowdfunding platform in Indonesia, by conducting interviews with the founders and users and observing their online interactions on the platform and social media. This study also collects data on Muslim philanthropic Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that actively used Kitabisa to raise funds, with special attention to Aksi Cepat Tanggap (ACT), one of Indonesia’s largest Muslim philanthropic NGOs. This study found that the trend of crowdfunding has amplified the inclusive space in Indonesian philanthropy where Muslim NGOs actively provide social services and enact collaborations with non-Muslims. However, through crowdfunding, Muslim NGOs have become more accommodating toward short-term social programs or ‘charity’. The crowdfunding trend has also raised accountability and transparency issues in Indonesian philanthropy. This study argues that the broader involvement of grassroots actors, either individuals or informal communities, through crowdfunding explains its impacts on Indonesian Islamic philanthropy’s trajectory for social justice. © (2024), (SEAS - Society for South-East Asian Studies).

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use several model specifications. The specifications mainly take the BWM’s characteristics and governance into account. The authors use a standard-panel data approach with a fixed-effects model as the Hausman test result favors the fixed-effects model. The authors collected monthly data from the Indonesia Financial Services Authority for the period 2018–2020. The detailed data, 39 BWM enabling us to observe the financial, social and governance elements of BWMs. Findings: The results reveal interesting findings. The authors find that BWM characteristics, governance and social capital are significant in shaping BWM’s sustainability, performance and risk. Furthermore, the authors find that BWM located in a province with higher lending density has lower performance than those located in a province with lower lending density. The results provide some evidence on how waqf-based microfinance could achieve both economic and social goals. It could provide perspectives for stakeholders in designing microfinance institutions.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose a productive waqf-based financing model for the livestock sector by optimizing idle waqf land owned by Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) for livestock breeding and fattening projects. Most pesantrens are established on waqf land and are located in rural areas with great potential for implementing waqf-based livestock projects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a critical review on the models of waqf-based empowerment and financing for the livestock, agriculture or agribusiness sectors. Then, a proposed model was designed focused on livestock sector by using waqf land owned by pesantren. To strengthen the proposed model, the authors held a focus group discussion (FGD) by inviting regulators, academics, practitioners/consultants in animal husbandry, waqf, pesantren and economic empowerment. Findings: Pesantren as nazhir of waqf land can cooperate with baitul maal wat tamwil (BMT) acting as nazhir of cash waqf to form a breeders’ cooperative as the vehicle to carry out the process of producing and fattening cattle. The project is performed under a mudharaba, musharakah or ijara contract, which is supervised by pesantren and BMT. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on the Indonesian context due to it is influenced by country-specific conditions. Even so, some of the findings in this study can still be adopted by waqf asset managers in other Muslim countries, which also have potential in terms of the number of pesantren and waqf assets. Social implications: The proposed model can improve the quality of life of the poor in remote areas by fulfilling the demand for beef consumption accompanied by sustainable economic empowerment. Originality/value: This research focuses on solving the problem of meeting basic needs for beef by optimizing productive waqf in the livestock sector by involving the role of pesantren, which still needs to be discovered in the literature on the use of waqf land. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Islamic financing has risen rapidly. However, the rapid rise of Islamic microfinance has resulted in strong competition for the community's awareness and willingness to become loyal consumers. Customer loyalty has been marketed as an easier and more trustworthy source of improved performance, and it is critical for the business's longterm sustainability. This study investigates the perceived value, satisfaction, and customer loyalty of Islamic microfinance institutions in Indonesia, using loyalty investigated as a mediator in the relationship between perceived value and satisfaction. SmartPLS was used to assess the structure and measurement model of three hundred thirty samples. The result of this study indicates that perceived value influences loyalty and satisfaction, and loyalty partially mediates the relationship between perceived value and satisfaction. According to the findings of this study, perceived value is vital for customer happiness and loyalty in Islamic microfinance institutions.

This type of research is included in qualitative research, which is derived from interviews and data observation. The source of this research data consists of primary data sources, namely researchers directly conduct interviews with the parties concerned in the process of exchanging waqf property at the At-Taqwa mosque, researchers also use secondary data sources, namely books, articles, and other reference materials. The results of the study explained that in the case of exchanging waqf property at Masjid At-Taqwa by Government Regulation Number 28 of 1977 and Law Number 41 of 2004. As for the aspect of Islamic Law, in the opinion of Imam Hanafi, if the waqf property can no longer provide benefits, it can be exchanged or replaced. On the contrary, according to the Shafi'iyah and Maliki Schools, it forbids all forms of exchange and replacement of waqf property under any circumstances. And according to Hanafiyah any form of exchange or replacement of all waqf objects depends on the power of the wakif at the time the pledge is pronounced by the wakif. The originality/novelty of this study offers originality by examining how changes in the status of waqf assets can affect people's welfare, both in terms of economics and society. In Islam, waqf is not only seen as charity but also as an economic instrument that can empower the community. Thus, a change in the status of waqf assets, for example from waqf land to commercial property, can have a significant impact on local economic empowerment. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {The young Muslim generation’s embracing digital platforms for Zakat payments represents a dynamic fusion of enduring religious values with the modern digital landscape, heralding a new era in Islamic charitable practices. This trend illustrates a profound transformation within the Islamic world, where the pillars of faith are being reimagined and revitalized through the lens of technological advancement. The present study delved into the factors influencing the young Muslim generation’s preference for digital platforms in Zakat transactions across Indonesia and Malaysia. We examined variables such as Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Trust, Zakat Literacy, and Digital Infrastructure, aiming to discern their impact on the propensity for digital Zakat contributions with the extension of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The research encompassed a diverse sample of 382 participants and utilized advanced methodologies, specifically Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS Multi Group Analysis (PLS-MGA), for rigorous data analysis. The results indicated that Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Digital Infrastructure, and Zakat Literacy notably influenced the use of digital platforms for Zakat. Furthermore, PLS-MGA uncovered significant cross-country differences where Digital Infrastructure showed a more pronounced positive impact in Malaysian context, whereas Social Influence had a greater effect in Indonesia. These findings offer critical insights into the young Muslim community’s digital engagement for religious financial obligations, underscoring the need for tailored digital Zakat solutions that cater to the unique preferences of this demographic. This research not only enriches the understanding of digital adoption in religious practices but also challenges the notion of a universal approach, advocating for context-specific strategies in the realm of digital religious financial services. Future researchers are suggested to consider longitudinal investigations as well as examining cross-regional contexts in this realm of research. © 2024 by author(s).},

The National Zakat Amil Agency (BAZNAS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Religion has taken important steps to empower this community through educational values-based programs. This research aims to analyze the role of collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA in efforts to empower the coastal communities of the Bajo Tribe through the utilization of zakat. This research uses empirical legal methods using empowerment theory. Community development and empowerment aims to change community conditions for the better, in educational, economic, social, cultural, and political aspects. Data was collected by means of in-depth interviews with BAZNAS, KUA, and the Bajo tribal community, while literature studies referred to relevant articles, books and research reports. The research results show that the collaboration between BAZNAS and KUA has contributed to changing the mindset of the Bajo Tribe in educating the Bajo Tribe community so that they improve spiritually, health and religious education. The challenges faced are the lack of realization of more massive program sustainability and the lack of active involvement of the community, stakeholders and the importance of realizing community empowerment through zakat environmental development in accordance with the BAZNAS RI program which is intended for community groups who experience economic, educational, health, spiritual and economic disadvantage welfare. Even though the results are not optimal, this contribution should be appreciated because it has had a significant impact on empowering the Bajo ethnic community on the Bone coast of South Sulawesi. © 2024, State Islamic University of Ar-Raniry Faculty of Sharia and Law.

The realm of research has grown intricate and fragmented, thereby posing a growing challenge to the regulation of waqf sustainability. The main purpose of this study is to organise and integrate the preliminary studies on the theme of waqf sustainability. To this end, this study involved bibliometric analysis, distinguishing it from previous analyses, which were outdated and/or different focus. We collected 84 articles extracted from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases, covering 20 years from 2001 to 2022. The findings showed that the most prolific authors were from Malaysia. There are five research themes regarding waqf sustainability, including the accountability of Islamic social finance as a third-sector economy, the sustainability of Islamic microfinance, the role of intellectual capital in waqf institutions, the effectiveness of management, and the performance measurement of waqf institutions. This study shows that the performance of waqf institutions for waqf sustainability is scant. Hence, there is an important research gap that can be addressed in future research since sustainability is a priority agenda as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) blueprint. © 2024 Vika Annisa Qurrata, Muhammad Hakimi Mohd.

	abstract = {Islamic Social Finance (ISF) is one solution for poverty alleviation, which is a major concern in developing countries like Indonesia. However, the performance of ISF in Indonesia, both in terms of collection and management, is still far from expectations. To address this problem, a digital transformation of ISF is needed by leveraging technologies that come with both advantages and disadvantages. This study employs a Delphi ANP-BOCR analysis to determine the most optimal technology for ISF digitalization, which result is supported by meta-analysis findings. The result shows that cloud computing is the most optimal technology when only benefits and costs are evaluated. When all factors, including benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, are considered, digital platform proves to be the most optimal technology for both the short and long term. BOCR analysis also confirms that digital platform and cloud computing are the most optimal technology. Meta-analysis further supports the contribution of digital platform in improving social finance performance. To optimize the implementation of ISF digitalization in Indonesia, this study provides an alternative model that incorporates multiple technologies. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.},

Using questionnaires administered to the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the empowerment programs in Central Lampung, South Tangerang, Trenggalek East Java, and Bima Nusa Tenggara Indonesia, the study constructs three impact indicators: the welfare index, financial inclusion index, and social and spiritual index. The data are analyzed using the difference-in-difference (DiD) method, where the three impact indices are compared between the two groups of respondents in 2021 and 2022. We find that the CWLS empowerment programs improve the welfare and financial inclusion of beneficiaries but have no discernible effect on social and spiritual participation. However, the DID analysis reveals that the overall impacts of welfare, financial inclusion, and social and spiritual participation are not statistically different between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in 2021 and 2022. This study provides significant implications for policymakers and nadzir to enhance the impacts of CWLS on socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. © 2024 Bank Indonesia Institute.

This has driven the availability of halal products as societal awareness of consuming halal goods continues to rise. However, this potential is not fully supported by the community's capability to act as suppliers of halal products due to limited financial support. Zakat, as a source of social finance, can contribute to the growth and sustainability of the halal industry. This study employs a qualitative descriptive method by reviewing articles related to zakat and its contributions to the development of the halal industry. The results show that zakat plays various roles in contributing to the growth and sustainability of the halal industry, including in social welfare and poverty alleviation, consumer trust and confidence, investment in education and skill development, support for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), infrastructure development, and the promotion of ethical business practices. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

	abstract = {The use of structured query formulation languages is a method for gaining access to data in information management systems. Writing structured queries is a powerful method of data retrieval, and end users can generate complex database queries by becoming proficient in a particular query language. Digitization of database information systems, history and endowment, and technology conservation are some examples of database conservation techniques in the process of displaying data that require optimal query techniques. Historical and endowment properties comply with a certain set of laws governing waqf recipients, which sets them apart from heritage and cultural assets. Trusted property typically comprises real estate, valuables, or both and has an infinite preservation term so long as it may still be put to use. A solid information technology infrastructure is essential for ensuring comprehensive data security. Given the availability of knowledge and the quick development of information technology, ensuring its sustainability is a challenge. This research is aimed at preserving historical and waqf databases based on the case study of the Kingdom of Sumedang Larang (KSL), Indonesia, through examination of the database, synchronization of digital data with physical data, as well as looking at its relationship with organizations and management. The proposed method, namely the Design and Analysis of Database Query Model for Preservation Information System (DAQMP), creates a recurring query model from the original tabular data placed in the next table as a special table check for data specifications containing important data. The results must be accurately aligned between digital and physical records regularly to serve as a record of any changes and as evidence to determine whether data has been corrupted, altered, or lost. © 2023 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: A series of interviews with four waqf officers who are involved with waqf reporting process from four different waqf institutions in Malaysia were conducted. Findings: The findings show a number of reasons for the current weak waqf reporting practices including the absence of standardised waqf reporting standards, no reporting or disclosure awareness by the waqf management, limited reporting channels from the state authorities to the national authorities, diversification in the governance structure and reluctance of waqf administration to disclose waqf reporting. The findings also identified several factors contributing to good waqf reporting practices. This includes leadership, good cultural setting within the institution, political will as a push factor, limited qualified personnel as well as sustainability issues and finally, the visibility of the waqf report itself. Practical implications: The study findings and recommendations are useful for the State Islamic Religious Councils and waqf institutions in Malaysia to enhance the waqf reporting practices in Malaysia. Originality/value: This study is among the few studies that identify the reasons and factors affecting the good waqf reporting practices in Malaysia. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan has allowed conventional insurance companies to start window takāful operations. An assessment of the performance of these operations is important to ascertain the sustainability of this model. Using data from 2010 to 2019, the top ten insurance companies, five of which are general and life insurance companies, have been selected for the analysis in this article. Ratio analysis is employed to analyse the financial performance of these entities before and after starting their operations in an event window setting. The results derived from the analysis are mixed as few indicators show better performance after starting a takāful business, but most indicators show results otherwise. Reasons for poor performance are lack of human resources, inadequate takāful business expertise, and injecting resources from conventional to takāful business. The findings of this study are important for understanding the performance of entities after starting a takāful business. © 2024 Electronicpublications.org Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: The problem of poverty requires a social innovation-based assistance strategy that involves various parties or collaboration in solving a social problem. Poverty alleviation policies are not only centered on bureaucratic aspects but are also always human-centered (human-centered design) in defining and formulating innovative policies. This research aims to identify stakeholders in social innovation in order to overcome the impacts of poverty. Theoretical framework: This research uses 6 dimensions of social innovation in analyzing the impact of poverty in Indonesia. Apart from that, this research also explains the role of stakeholders through the Quintuple Helix concept where there is a continuous balance between government and society. Method: This research is a type of qualitative research with 50 research informants who refer to five requirements for selecting informants. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with social practitioners so that researchers could get more concrete information about the problems that occurred. Results and conclusions: In the Social Exclusion Dynamics dimension, it was found that the Indonesian Government's policies were able to provide accelerated handling that was not trapped in bureaucratic, techno-technical aspects. By making the community work partners or volunteers who are socially active. The Mobilization of Resources dimension is related to the synergy aspect of multi-stakeholder involvement which is able to provide community capacity development, mastery and understanding of technological information so that it can improve the quality of life. In the Satisfaction of Human Needs dimension, pragmatism in the government system often causes a loss of innovation and creativity in exploring local resources in society. In the context of health service policy, it is often not possible to explore the source of the main problems in society. The dimension of empowerment is the creation of knowledge. Knowledge is data and information combined with ability, intuition, experience, ideas, and motivation from competent sources. In the dimension of Change in Social Relations, social innovation is ultimately able to determine permanent changes in the social environment, power, relations between social groups, government, and society, the state and the private sector. These dynamics are related to those displayed in the triangle of vision, intention, development culture, identity, organizational and institutional dynamics. Meanwhile, in the Territorial Specificity dimension, the research results show that funding for poverty alleviation activities is assisted by CSR programs from industry as well as social assistance from various elements of society, such as institutions, individuals, companies, zakat institutions, foundations, volunteers and others. Research implications: This research has implications for the involvement of stakeholders in social innovation in overcoming the impacts of poverty Originality/value: The value of this research lies in the application of the social innovation dimension through the role of multi-stakeholders in overcoming the impacts of poverty. The research results also provide new value to the role of organic intellectuals which refers to actors who play an important role in society. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {The role of small and medium enterprises has been growing significantly over the decades. This has reaffirmed the importance of SMEs as the backbone of the Malaysian and Indonesia economy, providing jobs and opportunities for growth. Waqf has also been recognized as a basic economic institution that generates economic activity while also guaranteeing that the benefits flow to specific segments of society. Therefore, this study aims to assess SMEs' intention to participate in waqf, involving two countries which are Malaysia, and Indonesia. A number of 165 valid questionnaires had been analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The study found that both knowledge and attitude were significant towards entrepreneur' intention to participate in waqf. Religiosity, however, was found to be insignificant. This indicates that one's religious views do not necessarily influence their intention to participate in waqf, since they acknowledge that their contribution aids community development. This study contributes to literature by investigating the religiosity, knowledge, and attitude on intention to participate in waqf among SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia and the findings are helpful and useful in term of assessing SMEs' intention to participate in waqf. Therefore, both countries should take the initiatives to provide training to equip SMEs with extensive knowledge through multiple platform in order to further encourage their participation on waqf. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Employing a multi-method qualitative research approach, the study integrateds qualitative insights from a comprehensive literature review and a comprehensive qualitative analysis through the grounded theory method, underpinned by principles of Islamic finance and contemporary financial innovation. The findings revealed that the proposed cash waqf model leveraged communal wealth for long-term developmental projects, ensuring sustainability and adherence to Islamic jurisprudence. The study concludes with the establishment of a specialized waqf institution to manage these funds, advocating for transparency and accountability to foster trust and a culture of philanthropy. The proposed model not only holds significant potential for transforming the economic landscape of Indonesia’s new capital but also offers a blueprint for integrating Islamic philanthropic principles with modern financial strategies, setting a precedent for similar initiatives globally. The research contributes to create a practical and sustainable financial framework that aligns with Indonesia’s cultural context and Islamic generosity traditions, facilitating infrastructure development and economic growth. © 2024, Universiti Teknologi Mara.

The research applied quantitative analysis method by distributing questionnaires to collect primary data from 111 mustahiq recipients of assistance from zakat institutions. This research employed a path analysis technique with the help of the SEM-PLS (Partial Least Squares) 4.0 program and was used to analyze the influence among variables. The empirical findings indicate that the productive zakat program significantly and positively affects mustahiq's welfare but not the business’s success. Meanwhile, entrepreneurial motivation and competence also significantly and positively affect business success and mustahiq welfare. Interestingly, the success factor for Islamic businesses can mediate the relationship between productive zakat, motivation, and competency on the welfare of mustahiq. This research contributes to the zakat literature by examining the connection between productive zakat, entrepreneurial drive, competency, and the factors influencing the performance of Islamic enterprises in achieving welfare according to Islamic objectives. Practically, the implications of this research are useful for the government as a policymaker in increasing the contribution of zakat institutions to material and spiritual poverty alleviation. © 2024, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

	abstract = {The tourism industry is among the largest contributor to the Malaysian and Indonesian economies. Aggressive measures have been taken to boost both countries as a leader in the tourism sector. To sustain the growing tourism industry, the government would have to increase its spending. Due to restricted budgetary resources, one choice for reducing government spending is to utilize the waqf model as an alternative mechanism that can assist the government in reducing spending. Waqf also aims to fulfill the social needs of the community besides it is an innovative way to fund the tourism industry without relying on government funding. Thus, this study attempts to address whether the waqf model can help the government of Malaysia and Indonesia to sustain the tourism industry. This study adopts the qualitative approach, through semi-structured interviews was conducted to generate items for a survey. Next, for quantitative, data were collected using an online questionnaire survey to gain input from a broader population. The sampling procedure adopted was purposive sampling. The study found that the waqf model can be used to sustain the tourism industry as well as waqf model can help the government reduce expenditure for the tourism industry. The contributions from the findings can be used by both countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, to enhance the application of the waqf model in many sectors, including tourism. This certainly will have major impacts on the economy for both countries. Therefore, it ensures long-term economic operations that will benefit communities and socio-economic activities. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Zakat is not merely a category of normative worship but also an aspect of mu’āmalah characterized by its adaptability. This notion is evident in the efforts of the National Zakat Agency (BAZNAS) of Kendal District to modernize zakat law, going far beyond what is stipulated in classical naṣ and fiqh. The modernization of zakat law at BAZNAS Kendal, the main focus of this article, is explored through empirical juridical research using a philosophical re-actualization approach, extensive interpretive analysis, and the theory of maqāṣidi ijtihād. The study finds that modernization is apparent in initiatives to mandate zakat from corporations as zakatable entities, with allocations for distribution in forms such as creative consumptive zakat for installing clean water facilities, creative productive zakat in the form of microfinance, and zakat for community development. Methodologically, Baznas Kendal employs the principles of maqāṣid al-shariֿ’ah, evident in its efforts to link normative zakat teachings (naṣ) with various dynamics of modern life (al-wāqi’) and considerations of social welfare as the essence of shari’a presence. Therefore, this study contributes to the reconstruction of pre-modern zakat law formulations whose conceptualization is no longer visible in the modern era into something more contextually meaningful, and it deepens the understanding of the conceptual framework for the modernization of zakat law that adheres to maqāṣid al-shariֿֿ’ah. Zakat bukan saja katagori ibadah kenormatifan yang given, melainkan juga mu’amalah dengan karakter adaptability (keberubahan). Anggapan ini terlihat dalam upaya Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (Baznas) Kabupaten Kendal memodernisasi hukum zakat jauh melampaui apa yang tertertuang dalam naṣ maupun fiqh klasik. Modernisasi hukum zakat di BAZNAS Kab. Kendal sebagai fokus utama dalam artikel ini menggunakan jenis penelitian yuridis empiris dengan pendekatan reaktualisasi filosofis dan analisis interpretatif ekstensif, dan teori ijtihād maqāṣidī. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa modernisasi hukum terlihat pada upayanya mewajibkan perusahaan sebagai objek yang dikenai zakat, sementara alokasi distribusinya dalam bentuk: zakat konsumtif kreatif berupa pemasangan saluran air bersih, dan produktif kreatif berupa zakat micro finance, serta zakat community development. Secara metodologis Baznas Kendal menggunakan dalil maqāṣid al-shari’a, hal ini terlihat pada upayanya mengaitkan antara ajaran normatif zakat (naṣ) dengan berbagai faktor dinamika kehidupan modern (al-wāqi’), serta pertimbangan kemaslatan sosial sebagai intisari kehadiran shari’a. Dengan demikian penelitian ini berkontribusi merekonstruksi formulasi hukum zakat pramodern yang konseptualisasinya tidak lagi visible di masa modern menjadi lebih memberi makna aplikasi kontekstualnya, serta memperdalam pemahaman kerangka konsepsional modernisasi hukum zakat berbasis maqāṣid al-shariֿֿ’ah. © 2024, null.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to explore the COVID-19 impact on the sustainability of gharimin (genuine debtors) in Islamic financial institutions (IFI) in Malaysia. The analysis was further conducted to expand the interpretation of gharimin in zakat institutions (ZI) to use the role of zakat distribution during the post-pandemic period due to income shock and long-term unemployment. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative research approach with grounded theory analysis to integrate theoretical insights into the interpretation of gharimin and current practices from the perspectives of ZI and IFI. An in-depth interview with 18 informants was conducted, and data were collected from senior management positions in the zakat distribution department, academicians who are experts in the area of zakat, and heads of Shariah departments in IFI. Findings: Expanding the interpretation of gharimin could help ZI and IFI recover the sustainability of gharimin for preparedness during post-pandemic and any emergency crisis in the future. Practical implications: This study implies the potential role of ZI in combating the risk of defaulting debtors in IFI to prepare for pandemic recovery in the future. Social implications: The new interpretation assists gharimin in reducing the burden debt using the zakat fund and protects genuine debtors by preventing IFI from declaring default or bankruptcy. Originality/value: This study narrows the literature gaps about gharimin in IFI in the context of the pandemic. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is, perhaps, the first paper to present the expansion of interpretation for gharimin into mu’sir in IFI in Malaysia. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In this cross-sectional study, an investigation was conducted by collecting primary data from 379 household heads to examine the impact of social safety nets on household-level food security in the Torghar district of Northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The comprehensive analysis encompassed the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate levels. The bivariate analysis revealed issues and shortcomings related to access to social safety nets, particularly within the Zakat system. These issues included corruption and nepotism, which hindered poverty alleviation strategies and the well-being of vulnerable households. Additionally, complex bureaucratic procedures and regulations impeded social interventions, and political factors posed a substantial obstacle. At the multivariate level, the study identified the specific factors contributing to food insecurity. Respondents from extended family systems, individuals aged between 46 and 55 years, and those with religious education were found to be more vulnerable to food insecurity. While social safety nets held promise for addressing food sustenance challenges among local low-income citizens, the negative impacts of political involvement, favoritism, and nepotism were evident and required urgent attention. These findings emphasize the need for coordinated efforts among the government, social safety net officials, and community to identify and rectify these existing issues. Fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility regarding the role and implementation of social safety nets towards achieving food security is crucial to enhancing their viability and effectiveness, ensuring continuous support for those in need. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Zakāt on Agriculture, as one aspect of Islamic finance and philanthropy, is crucial in supporting community welfare and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This research examines the philanthropy movement driven by agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga in the Langkat Regency, Indonesia. It adopts a qualitative approach, employing a phenomenological study through in-depth interviews. This research involved three key groups as research subjects: 10 amil zakāt (who are responsible for zakāt administration), 15 zakāt payers, and 35 zakāt recipients. The research findings reveal that philanthropic activities involving agricultural zakāt at Desa Mangga can be categorized into consumption-oriented and production-oriented activities. In contrast to the traditional approach of distributing zakāt mainly to relieve financial burdens, Desa Mangga has adopted a more proactive strategy in managing agricultural zakāt funds. The funds are directed towards productive businesses such as palm sugar production, stalls, and farmland management. As achieving complete economic independence continues, the effective allocation of agricultural zakāt funds at Desa Mangga progressively empower recipients to become more economically self-reliant. Nevertheless, it is crucial to highlight that, in practice, the concept of empowerment within zakāt philanthropy at Desa Mangga has yet to reach its full potential. Charitable activities still dominate the distribution of zakāt funds, inadvertently fostering dependency among zakāt recipients. © The Authors.},
